There are certain moments, specially from the keyboards, that feels like Vangelis's score for Blade Runner. It's almost like if you were listening a Sci-Fi movie insted of watching it. And the fact that the album has a ton of different versions (original release, remaster release etc) is pure Blade Runner type thing.

Just like other Porcupine Tree albums like Deadwing feel like a Lynchian/Kubrickian arthouse movie made into a Progressive Metal album.  The remastered edition is a gem. Whenever I went on long car rides with my parents, I would listen to the Alternate Version and just get lost in the noise while latching onto certain riffs and hooks. Like the section in the middle where everything quiets down and the acoustic guitar shifts to a three-bar chord. Sometimes I would jump from the Alternate Version to the regular album version and compare the quality in the recording and editing. It's really cool. 

As a sidenote, not necessarily from a super visual standpoint, but *Voyage 34 Phase II* has been in heavy circulation in my music player lately. The first two phases of that album, for some reason, have a spiritual and emotional connection with me and kind of have that visual-conjuring ability that *The Sky Moves Sideways* has.

Thick As a Brick by Jethro Tull! To me this album exemplifies everything great about prog rock. The issue I have with Close to the Edge is that there isn’t enough diversity or ‘themes’ on the album - the title track wastes too much time on jamming and ‘atmospheric’ bits - granted the main melodies are excellent but it’s not enough to justify the running time. Thick as a Brick packs about 15 themes into its running time and they are all excellent, spanning the gamut from poppy to epic. The instrumentals are also brilliant even if they’re not mind-boggingly complex like some Yes or King Crimson jams. However this has the benefit of making them feel less cluttered, and all the song transitions are excellent. Also, lyrically this album is one of the finest of the progressive era, with brilliant and highly metaphorical imagery combined with some excellent wordplay and tongue-in-cheek moments. Only Genesis can come close on this front.

So some friends and me dropped acid and we were going through the expected albums: Dark Side, and Sgt. Peppers, Massive Attack, Autechre, etc... then at one point I'm going through my friends cd collection and notice a box-set on the top of his shelf and it's got some weird looking lion on it with ELP written on the front (The Return of the Manticore ).

I asked what it was... now I should note that my friend that had it was really only into Reggae and Hip-Hop and barely knew rock music.  In fact that night I think I introduced him to Pink Floyd.  

Anyway, I asked him about the box set and he didn't know what it was.  Apparently he got it for free years ago during those Columbia House 10 cds for a penny things that everyone abused to no end and since he got it in a big bundle, he never actually opened it and forgot about it.  

So I put it on and the first track I heard was Tarkus and man did everything in my musical life change.  It was intense.  Thanks to acid and an open mind I was floored by the complexities that I was hearing as well as amazed that it was a three piece.  That was about 8 years ago and no joke, it's totally affected my interest in music and my playing forever.

Here's the lyrics to In Earnest, by his band The Tangent:

I - The Radio Amateur  
  
Keying his mic' as he searches for life,  
A gentle old man sits alone in the dark,  
He's scanning the waves,  
Looking for memories he can share.  
  
His correspondants collect him like stamps,  
Adding his callsign to their trophies and maps,  
And none of them wonder just who it is they're talking to,  
None of them think to ask the kind of man he was...  
  
""I was a pilot, in a war long ago  
and it all seemed to matter way back then...""  
  
And now and then he feels the ground-rush,  
As his plane hits the air,  
Or feel his ground crew rally round him once again.  
  
II - Worthy of Memory (Part 1)  
  
He remembers everything about flying Spitfires, sending Morse,  
The crackle of the radio, the tension of the news reports,  
He flew to save his people!  
His people do not want to know him now.  
  
He remembers every detail about that sand-bagged days,  
But every chapter that came after, vanishes in blurry haze,  
He has no great love story, just medals and a glory, gone for good.  
He gave his youth - Just like he should.  
  
III - Demobilized  
  
He demobbed in 1945 as the world he'd fought for came alive,  
He looked for his friends to find that the most of them had gone.  
He scanned the radio for the next few years, until the last ones disappeared,  
  
When no-one has laft, our Earnest looked to pastures new, from his viewpoint,  
A mile above the ground,  
He looked down on his oyster, green and blue.  
  
IV - Dehumanized  
  
He sits in a hundred countries, counting off his latter years, while...  
Leaders sit in panelled War-Rooms, fulled by their peoples' fears,  
They'll find so many willing,  
So many, ready to do what he had done.  
  
V - Flights of Fancy  
  
He rememberes smoky jazz bars in the years after the war,  
The feeling of nostalgia was creeping up and taking over.  
And after that it all just seemed the same,  
How could he ever equal it again?  
  
And in his flights of fancy he's still the captain of his crew  
His navigator on the double bass?  
Is that Lofty up there with him too?  
But it all came down so fast,  
And this be-bop won't last  
And in his flights of fancy he never even left the R.A.F.  
It all came down so fast, and,  
Earnest only has the past,  
He's a hero in november  
But all year long he's last in the Queue  
  
VI - Worthy of Memory (Part 2)  
  
He remembers something - about a motorbike in Lincolnshire?  
A rally -- for Ham Radio?, his kids on a trip?, to Brighton Pier?  
His heart is in the 40's  
His roaring engines still sport his name...  
In Earnest, we all have a friend.  
  
VII - The Silent Key (Instrumental)  
  
VIII - Earnest Dreams of 617  
  
Lifelong memories as he hits the dam  
of Boucing Bombs and slide rules,  
Radio cans...  
It's Earnest in the cockpit and he'll never know  
A momento to compare with this one,  
In the world... below  
  
IX - Some Crazy Old Guy  
  
Sipping his spite as he sits at the bar  
A lonely old man sits alone with his thoughts  
Around him we buzz, and never notice that he's there.  
He's in the way when we order our drinks,  
He's there every night of the week,  
Some Crazy Old Guy who tells those stories all the time...  
...But he's not with us, he's miles away from here,  
In the only past we gave him worth his thoughts.  
So we'll never see his Spitfire as it makes its final roll,  
And we'll never learn the lessons he was taught.  
  
X - In Earnest  
  
Don't leave me nostalgic for the wrong things in my life,  
I don't want adventures among your grand designs of war!  
I'll take a clear morning with the wind in my hair,  
I beg you, In Earnest, for nothing more.",In Earnest,The Tangent,87.5,77.77777777777779,"['The song includes elements like Morse code and radio crackle.', 'The song structure includes different parts, some with instrumental segments.']",[],['The song relates to nostalgic moments of flying Spitfires and participating in ham radio activities.'],"['The song evokes feelings of nostalgia for wartime experiences.', 'It provides a melancholic yet reflective mood about past adventures and memories.']","['The song tells a story of an old man reflecting on his past as a pilot.', 'The storytelling includes vivid imagery of WWII experiences.', 'The lyrics explore themes of memory and the passage of time.']",['The song is performed by The Tangent and features complex lyrical content.'],"[['In Earnest', 'The Tangent']]","The song performed by The Tangent features complex lyrical content and includes elements like Morse code and radio crackle.

As matter of fact I really hated DBM.  I really loved the hard sound of Grunge.  I was gifted with ""Before these Crowded Streets"" which sat on my shelf for about a year unopened.  

I am not one to partake in smoke (I have a love/Hate relationship with it).  A few friends busted out with some at my apartment one evening.  Well, I busted out some Rush – [Villa de Strangiato](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=593xyObzI8Y) thinking some light music would go good with the new atmosphere.  The weed had not really hit me, but it hit a friend who was not familiar with Rush.  She started getting a bit weirded out, and the song was just starting.  She said ‘it is to repetitive’ she could not handle it.  I said not realizing she was starting to freek ‘Don’t worry, it will change’. At exactly that [instant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=593xyObzI8Y#t=02m19s) the song changed.  She got very upset and said ‘you are fuking with my head’.  That is when it hit me.  The timing could not have been better.  I was torn between her being upset, and the amazing dialog she Rush and I just had.

My friend ran into the other room. I decided that Rush was not the right music at the moment. It was astonishingly hard to hit stop on my CD player.  She called a friend in the other room, and I was felling good. I didn’t feel like dealing with a bad trip.  What now?

Something a little milder was in order. DMB ""Before these Crowded Streets"". Not my first choice, but it was played on the radio ad nauseum and was familiar to all.  A few moments to peal away incredibly difficult sticky wrapping, and in it goes. “Shuffle”.  I start talking with another friend. How are you doing? bla bla bla. 

Time goes buy.  

[‘Don’t Drink the Water’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFbFwmIKlqM) starts playing.  ‘Great, the radio is on’ I think to myself.  

The song starts to slow down… everything starts to slow down.  I feel the rolling bass open up a part of my brain, that strange distant part, which is dormant most of the time.  The violin starts pulling me towards it wrapping me in it’s tendrils.  A very subtle presence was in there, a dancing, hopping sentient being. Something I have never experienced before. It is talking, but not using words.  It is firing between the spaces of my synapses. It told me to stay, hear, and relax while it dances for me. It is a Banjo.  Dave’s voice then says ‘I will spread my wings’.  I understood no other lyrics. I now love Dave Matthews Band.  I then fully grasped what others saw in them.

I am glad I did not hear the lyrics to the song, they are depressing.  DMB does have some very happy songs that I treasure [Trippin Billys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyBgXxmpwCs#t=54m13s) for example.

I don’t know if DMB is a prog group or not, but what you are asking for is the moment that changed my outlook on a group and this was it.  I had a moment like this when listening to Rush, but that story is still rattling around in my head.

Basically, I broke into Roundabout and it was just like ***wow***, I understand why Yes are so big in the prog canon. From what I knew from their best-of, they sounded kind of 'old' for my liking, but really listening to the way the guitar, bass and keys sat over each other in the verse, contrasted with the amazing rock guitar riff in the chorus - there was just an amazing colourful instrumental aesthetic combined with this incredible performance and compositional energy.

Then I got to the bridge, (*Along the drifting cloud/The eagle searching down on the land*) and I thought the repeated riff was a bit uninspired but I thought ""eh, they'll recover"". But it never did. The rest of the album had some nice hooks here and there, but I didn't (and still don't really) get the short tracks, I wasn't that impressed by the compositional display, and they never got back to the level of energy that kicked off Roundabout.

The definition in the sidebar states, in brief, abstract or lyrics covering more serious topics along with atypical or technically skilled musical structures.

So, let's go along with that and quickly look at the lyrics of the two songs. One is about post-partum depression, a rather difficult topic which I've never seen be approached by any artistic mediums, much less rock music. The song is sung from the perspective of the mother and the child, using lyrics slightly altered to suit each viewpoint.

The second is a more upbeat song about a young boy with autism, and the troubles he and his family face throughout his life. Yet another theme you'd scarcely see in Top 40 radio. 

Since the two were both part of a much larger, 42-minute song, they were meant to compliment each other and be played live together (since they came in succession on the album), which is what they aim to do, musically. Goodnight Kiss's quiet, downbeat narrative slowly escalates through the end of the song and is then picked up by Solitary Shell's upbeat, keyboard-laden intro and continued throughout the song. Even though Solitary Shell is meant to be upbeat and catchy, the song structure still manages to avoid the standard pop song structure. Other than how well they mesh together, what can I say about the instrumentation? Dream Theater are generally recognized to be extremely skilled at their trade, and rightfully so. I can't speak for the other band members firsthand, but as a guitarist of many years, I find that I *still* can't easily play John Petrucci's pieces, and if I could, it would take me an unreasonable amount of work. Even Solitary Shell, which is one of his easier pieces, is fairly difficult to learn.

That's my (sleepy) take on its validity as a prog rock song, anyway. I can't make you think it's a good song, if that's what you meant, but that's my reasonably detailed explanation as to why it would fit in this subreddit. I try to post a nicely varied group of stuff, so if you don't like this, I hope you like some of the other things myself or the other contributors post. :)",Goodnight Kiss,Dream Theater,77.77777777777779,81.81818181818183,"['quiet, downbeat narrative in Goodnight Kiss', 'upbeat, keyboard-laden intro in Solitary Shell', ""Dream Theater's technically skilled musical structures""]","['Goodnight Kiss and Solitary Shell are part of a 42-minute song', 'Solitary Shell avoids standard pop song structure', 'Dream Theater recognized for skilled instrumentation', ""John Petrucci's pieces are difficult to play""]",['songs meant to be played live together'],"['quiet, escalating narrative', 'upbeat and catchy yet non-standard structure']","['Goodnight Kiss covers post-partum depression from the perspective of the mother and child', 'Solitary Shell covers a young boy with autism and his family']","['Goodnight Kiss and Solitary Shell part of a larger, 42-minute song']","[['Goodnight Kiss', 'Dream Theater'], ['Solitary Shell', 'Dream Theater']]","The songs ""Goodnight Kiss"" and ""Solitary Shell"" are part of a larger, 42-minute composition by Dream Theater and feature their technically skilled musical structures.

Let me start out saying that this album may be one of my all time favorites. The atmosphere is so engrossing, the story so confusing yet identifiable and the sound of the album is different than any other album out there. It may be long, winding, and at times hard to follow, but due to just the atmosphere the songs create and the sound of the album itself I can continue to listen to this album all the way through, over and over again, and feel like it's my first time hearing it. 

The first track just hooks me in every time I listen to it. That piano into is so dramatic and lovely. 
The following 2 tracks are some of the best uses of the Mellotron by Genesis. Cuckoo Cocoon always reminds me of drinking coffee on a rainy day and sounds so cozy. In The Cage is probably my favorite of Bankk' synth solos. I've spent many moons trying to learn it. Grand Parade is probably my least favorite on the first side, but lyrically is engaging enough to me that I can appreciate it for the impact it has on the album. 

Back in NYC is one of the most aggressive tracks Genesis has recorded up to this, next to The Knife and Apocalypse in 9/8. I always liked the sound of hairless heart, but I wish that it was developed more musically. Carpet Crawlers is one of my favorite Genesis tracks. I have a lot of memories from my junior year of high school attached to this song, and the vocals are just so haunting and beautiful. I like Chamber of 32 Doors almost as much as Carpet Crawlers, and is almost as beautiful to me, but it feels a bit...segmented to me. Lillywhite Lilith is probably the most forgettable song on the entire album, but almost redeems itself at the end with the reprise of the Broadway Melody of 1974 closer to the end. The Waiting Room is plain annoying at the beginning, but when the more melodic section kicks in, the song redeems itself and becomes more than listenable. Anyway is a great little piece that, like Hariless heart, could've been developed more. Here Comes The Supernatural Anesthetist has one of my favorite guitar moments in the whole album; right when the rest of the band comes in after the intro. The Lamia is haunting and beautiful almost in the same way as Carpet Crawlers, and is probably the strangest track in the whole album, barring Colony of Slippermen. Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats is a fantastic ambient piece. I can just feel Rael's sadness and remorse for his actions when looked at in context of the story, but by itself, it sounds more like passing on to the afterlife. I will probably have this song playing at my funeral. 

Colony of Slippermen is probably the most narrative track of the album. I absolutely ADORE the little synth solo at 3:55, and even more when it repeats over the vocals later on. The synth solo that is supposed to depict the raven flying off with Rael's penis does exactly what it sets out to do. The Ravine is yet again another fantastic ambient track, and manages to convey the size and depth of the ravine. The Light Does Down on Broadway, while not the most lyrically strong track in the album, has some very nice reprises, and those reprises make the song emotional and almost make up for the lyrics. Riding the Scree opens with what I feel is Banks' most technical, hardest solo to play. I can feel myself sliding down the cliff with the wind in my hair. In the Rapids Serves it's purpose as a hook into It, which is my favorite Phil moment on the whole album. The drumming is fanatically energetic, and serve to showcase what the drumming I feel Phil Collins should've done more. The album ends, leaving me wanting more, yet at the same time I know that Rael's story has come to a conclusion.  

This album is reminiscent of Tales of Topographic Oceans in that it is either love it or hate it, yet it has so much more sustenance and meat to it than it or even The Wall that I can say that it's my favorite rock opera and in my upper echelon of albums.

Let me start out saying that this album may be one of my all time favorites. The atmosphere is so engrossing, the story so confusing yet identifiable and the sound of the album is different than any other album out there. It may be long, winding, and at times hard to follow, but due to just the atmosphere the songs create and the sound of the album itself I can continue to listen to this album all the way through, over and over again, and feel like it's my first time hearing it. 

The first track just hooks me in every time I listen to it. That piano into is so dramatic and lovely. 
The following 2 tracks are some of the best uses of the Mellotron by Genesis. Cuckoo Cocoon always reminds me of drinking coffee on a rainy day and sounds so cozy. In The Cage is probably my favorite of Bankk' synth solos. I've spent many moons trying to learn it. Grand Parade is probably my least favorite on the first side, but lyrically is engaging enough to me that I can appreciate it for the impact it has on the album. 

Back in NYC is one of the most aggressive tracks Genesis has recorded up to this, next to The Knife and Apocalypse in 9/8. I always liked the sound of hairless heart, but I wish that it was developed more musically. Carpet Crawlers is one of my favorite Genesis tracks. I have a lot of memories from my junior year of high school attached to this song, and the vocals are just so haunting and beautiful. I like Chamber of 32 Doors almost as much as Carpet Crawlers, and is almost as beautiful to me, but it feels a bit...segmented to me.

I loved Advent of Panurge, but thought Raconteur Troubadour was just ok. Cry For Everyone was pretty rockin'. I love the violin and various horns throughout these songs.

Then there's Knots. I pretty much reacted to this how I did the first time I heard Thoughts by Spock's Beard. Discordant and hard to listen to, but I could get into it someday, maybe. In fact, I'd venture to guess they modeled Thoughts after that, the two seem strikingly similar.

The Boys in the Band was a pretty good track, and Dog's Life is odd. Think of Me With Kindness is a very pleasant track. River was a pretty damn solid track.

(No pun intended) When we discussed Fragile, I was a bit sad that we weren't discussing Close to the Edge, because I like this one just a bit more. Both are great, don't get me wrong, but I love this album. I'd rank this one in my top ten, easily.

Three tracks. I remember in high school when I got Pink Floyd's Animals and Wish You Were Here, and I was blown away that both only had five tracks. Guess I should have dug deeper, haha.

I'm fortunate enough that my parents had great taste, and they have this one on vinyl, which I spin up from time to time.

OK, onto the songs. Close to the Edge, aka Side 1. Amazing track, one of my favorite songs of all time. This one and Supper's Ready are the two songs I would always listen to while driving to school to take a test. Kind of a good luck thing. The whole track is excellent, but what is easily my favorite part is the church organ part in the middle. I get chills every time. I'll have to find the sheet music for that part someday, and get the lady who plays the organ at a church I play bass at to play it sometime. The musicianship on this track is so tight, from the chaotic intro, to the last declaration of getting up and getting down.

And You and I is a beautiful track. Slow and just epic-sounding. I love that synth line that comes in around 6:20. That's probably my favorite part of this track.

Siberian Khatru is, sadly, my least listened to track on this album. Probably because when I usually listen to this one in the car or wherever, I'm usually to where I'm going by the time this one comes on. However, it's still a great track. My favorite part of this track is probably that vocal part that comes in near the end.

For Merzbow, if you don't really like harsh noise music, I would recommend one of his collaborative works with rock artists, such as his work with Boris. *Rock Dream* by Boris &amp; Merzbow is a nice live set which features like 7 heavy-rock songs by Boris in between of some of the drone/doom tracks of Boris, of course, all of this made more awesome by Merzbow's ambientation. *Sun Baked Snow Cave* is a lovely 1-hour track of ambient noise, and I like it very much. Merzbow's solo works are hard to get into… but personally I like *1930* over his other work, as it is more rhythmic and violent than the rest. The problem is that noise music is very diverse and open, so one does not really know what to expect from artists or albums. *Merzbuddha* is nice too, very mantra-like (the three tracks are titled Mantra) and therefore repetitive and rhythmical, and not utterly chaos like other discs.

The greatest live band of our generation had a seminal year in 2013. Since their reunion in 2009, they have been improving in consistency, but couldn't match the levels of technical mastery, improvisational daring, and childlike joy of their mid-90's heyday--until 2013.

Lately I've been delving into The Mars Volta's catalog, and I've listened to Haken's ""The Mountain"" at least 50 times since it's release.  

&gt; This is some hard rockin' stuff. Much less lightweight than prog albums from the same year - but there's certainly enough orchestral and jazziness to call this prog. How do you like this kind of heavy-prog? Reminds me of Rush, personally.    

I can hear it. The guitar solo in 'Salisbury' reminded me of the solo in By-Tor and the Snowdog, but only less chaotic. The problem I had wasn't with the heaviness, but it's that up until the song 'Salisbury', the album sounded mostly like a classic rock album.  

&gt;How would you personally rate the album?  

I thought it was good, it had the feel of Rush pre-Caress of Steel, with a good dose of Kansas. I'd consider it Prog-Lite, as in Prog I can throw on at social gatherings without people thinking I'm a nut job. 7/10 if I had to put a number to it.   

&gt;Are there any moments on the album you consider particularly strong or particularly weak (i.e., favourite/least favourite moments)?

The titular track is a long lead-in to ""When You're In"", and I absolutely adore both. ""When You're In"" has a deep and dirty thumping melody, very reminiscent of Another Brick In The Wall.

My favorite track has to be Mudmen. It's just simply sublime and indescribable. Atmospheric, melodic, very ""Any Color You Like"". I wish that single track went for an hour. 

""Childhoods End"" immediately made me think of one of my favorite-as-a-kid Arthur C Clarke books, but listening to the lyrics I thought there was no way as it doesn't make contextual sense. A quick wiki confirmed that it was in fact inspired by the book, and I guess I can sort of see it but it feels like I'm forcing myself.  
Regardless it's a wonderful song, Gilmour's usual melodic up-then-deep-up-then-deep fashion well suited to the storytelling of romantic concepts. 

""Stay"" makes me shed a tear for missed chances... and some that weren't missed as well. Water's influence is heavy on this one. 

This album brought to me the knowledge of the existence of Gilmour's floating recording studio, [the *Astoria*](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria_\(recording_studio\)), which is just the coolest thing.

Part of it is definitely that I'm 22 so the height of the genre's popularity was right when I was at the age all of my friends and classmates were skating (not me, I'm clumsy as hell) and what not. But now that I'm older I know why I like it other than nostalgia or pop culture. I LOVE a good hook, and I like tight, polished playing and production whether it's written for the masses or not. And the hooks don't get much better than on a blink-182 or Yellowcard record. The melodies utilized in the genre are usually just super upbeat and put you in a good mood. It makes you look back on sneaking out of the house to go to a party in high school and laugh about it, because whilenmost of the bands write pretty ""rise up against the parents"" type lyrics, they're very tongue-in-cheek. 

Also, like any genre, there are those bands that decide to branch out and add some complexity to their music. If you don't believe me, check out Mmhmm by Relient K or Brand New Eyes by Paramore. Still undeniably pop punk records, but the arrangements, musicianship, and lyrical content are much more respectable. 

Last, the music is just fun to listen to. I spend so much time being a lofty progger, soaking my brain and ears in pretensions and intelligent music, that sometimes I just need to hear Mark Hoppus say, ""it's labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fucking hot dogs."" It's like being a food critic and going for fast food. You spend all your meals in fancy restaurants eating gourmet dishes that are unique and refine your pallet with every indulgence, but sometimes you just a need a fucking chicken nugget. Chopped and formed, predictable, familiar. And yet still delicious.

It Bites (of old) has been a favourite discovery of mine. Mostly due to the new It Bites fronted by John Mitchell of Frost*. I thought ""The Tall Ships"" was a masterpiece of 80's pop and modern prog. 

From what little I heard of the old It Bites it just seemed like on of the many same-sounding 80's rock bands (although I enjoyed that sound a lot, Screamin on the Beaches was pretty great i thought, just not anything worth checking out further). This changed when I heard the new It Bites play Once Around the World live, I thought the song was all over the place and really weird but had that cool 80's vibe too. So I thought i'd check out the song as it was recorded as the song/album seemed pretty revered. 

That's when it hit me, hearing this song transported me back to 1988 (even though that was the year of my birth, I love the 80's spirit, guess it's in my blood). Francis Dunnery's care free vocals sold it to me, and the melding of 80's goodness with playful prog rock was right up my alley. The first two albums are great, with the second one being perfect, haven't listened too much of their 3rd as it seems they succumbed to pressure from their label to move away from prog. After that it seemed that Francis Dunnery lost motivation to continue striving to bring prog to the masses, and succumbed to the evils. A shame, but at least we have his moment of genius captured for all to share.

Old Man and The Angel is one of my all-time favourite It Bites song.

Without trying to get any more sappy, Duke is an album that just feels good. It's not overwhelmingly cerebral; it's got a great balance of emotional depth and more straight-forward song-spinning. 

It's fitting this album came out 1980, 'cause it really sounds like the first time the members were able to forget some of the baggage of the last decade.

This is why pop exists.  Progressive Rock requires patience enough to listen to a *whole 8 to 20+ minute song*, take in all the unfamiliar sounds, perhaps not knowing what to think of the song on first listening, and then listening to it a couple more times before falling in love with it.  Of course, once one is a huge fan of prog, that last part no longer really applies since its possible to immediately like a prog song for because you are more familiar with the eccentricities of the genre.

I remember clearly when I was first getting into prog.  I was a big fan of psychedelic rock and while I was listening to an old web radio that I forget the name of (Technicolor Web of Sound? something like that, this was a decade or two ago) Yes' Astral Traveler came on and I loved it.  I saw that they got started pretty late in the 60s and I briefly listened to Starship Trooper, Roundabout, and Close to the Edge and kind of didn't give it another thought.  Starship Trooper's first part was really dull and slow and even repetitive and although I liked where the song went (believe it or not I had heard Bodast's Nether Street before this song, and so I recognized Wurm immediately), I didn't have the patience to wait through the whole part I didn't like to get to the part I liked.  Same happened for Close to the Edge, absolutely dissonant and chaotic sounding beginning that I didn't know how to process and it went on for way to long for me to enjoy it.  Roundabout was ok, and I liked the chorus but again, I couldn't figure out why they dragged the songs out so long.

But a part of it itched at me because there was something there that I liked.  I did like the ending of Starship Trooper, and the middle part, so I listened to the song a couple more times just for that, and eventually got over my dislike of the first part and see how it all connected together.  I can't remember what provoked me but one day I just got all of Yes' albums, their debut album through Going for the One and listened to all of it.  Instead of listening to it head on, I put it on in the background while I did other stuff.  After having listened to everything there was a bunch of songs off of The Yes Album and Fragile that I liked, especially Your Move, We Have Heaven, A Venture, and The Fish.  Eventually I fell in love with And  You and I for its epicness, and then was no longer bothered by the song length as I listened more closely to the details of the song and how it changed in mood and tone and built up to the climax at the end.  It wasn't long after that that I was listening to Tales from Topographic Oceans on loop and loving it.

So, TL;DR prog is complicated, hard to get into because of how long the songs are, and because the reason why its enjoyable to listen to isn't necessarily because of a catchy riff or chorus or bridge, but from the prowess of the band for playing something extremely impressive or zany or unpredictable or from the sense of epic catharsis that the song is much bigger than itself.

Prog is a whole different story. Those songs are similar to relationships or good friends. You get to know them. You keep relistening to those masterpieces and you keep finding new things you love about them, new lights to see them in.  
To get to this point, you have to be able to open yourself to the song. These songs show you their darker side. Nothing in life is like pop music. There are dissonances on every corner, problems to overcome and patterns are placed by us.  
Prog music reflects those things. I swear, some songs take me on an emotional roller coaster (check out Deadman or New Day by Karnivool for prime examples, or since we are a prog community a whole album of theirs if you haven't). Prog makes me quite introspective most of the time.

Many people just don't want this. They want to be amused, they want to dance, they want to forget those everyday things. Music is something that should be in the background. Something that can be consumed without much thought. That does not work with prog.

Songs that come to mind are (in no particular order):

* [Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7EpSirtf_E)

* [Frank Zappa - Yo Mama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38_buPdNiI)

* [Drive Home - Steven Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycYewhiaVBk)

* [Marillion - Chelsea Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLcOqfpS1_4)

* Almost all good Rush songs So many contenders... the OP's list is pretty great already. But I've got a few to add.

On the subject of ""emotional - not necessarily extremely technical"", these two come especially to mind:

[Gordian Knot - Muttersprache] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOaoPa3-83U&amp;t=2m36s)

[Dream Theater - Lines in the Sand] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXV9hRio50k&amp;t=9m49s)

...although there is immense technicality in both of those. Just not the ""fast, complex and wide""-kind, instead technicality in picking angle, picking position, accidentals, micro-timing, the details of phrasing etc.

(Honorable mention: [Overhead - Point of View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8k79HTrPi8) - almost the entire song is one big, building, beautiful guitar solo)

Drive Home pretty much takes the cake though when it comes to these kinds of solos... for me (subject to change).

When it's ""weird crazy"" you want - can't go wrong with Adrian Belew and Robert Fripp - take [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvE3dYKHxwU&amp;t=51m9s) from their ToaPP-Tour.

Or, alternatively - take Fripp's more majestic, ethereal works - for example [Fripp &amp; Eno - Evening Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REkbY-eEuus), or [this introductory Soundscapes from the Eyes Wide Open - Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzrq425iGVg&amp;t=1m36s) (if you want to count that as a 'solo').

If we don't limit ourselves to prog-*rock* - contemporary Prog Metal has so many amazing guitarists to. Of course you have ""new giants"" like AAL, BTBAM and PtH etc.

But I'd like to draw attention to three really amazing, extremely talented, very young (and incidentally mostly eastern-european) guitarists:

* David Maxim Micic - Bilo / Destiny Potato

* Jakub Zytecki - Disperse / Bilo

* Owane

[Also: Sithu Aye &amp; Plini]


The distinguishing features about these is their incredible attention to tone, voicings, attack, palm-muting, phrasing - as well as a flair for pleasing jazzy harmony-progressions. Every millisecond of every tone seems carefully crafted and refined.

[Here's an example of Jakub Zytecki's jazzy, nuanced playing - Enigma of Abode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STQwFUd1KeY&amp;t=3m09s)

[Notice the right hand technique in this section - the interplay between foreground and background - also very nice solo-flourish towards the end (Profane the Ground)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbFUL4MprBY&amp;t=3m28s)

[This solo by David Maxim Micic is one of my absolute favs - a great demonstration of technical variety and carefully crafted melody-progression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t1WX9WXQZg&amp;t=8m31s)

[This solo by Micic is more the ""classical"" kind of rock-star guitar solo à la Steve Vai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t1WX9WXQZg&amp;t=31m15s)

[Here's a nice jazzy little jam by Owane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFtNArNwqPk)

####Potential Discussion Questions:

* Lets compare this one to the previous one (chronologically) by Marillion: Misplaced Childhood.  Both concept albums, but a very decidedly different sound. 

* How would you personally rate the album?

* Are there any moments on the album you consider particularly strong or particularly weak (i.e., favourite/least favourite moments)?

___
^contributions, ^comments ^&amp;amp; ^corrections ^are ^welcome.  ^Message ^/u/BenBenBenBe. I love this album. There was no doubt at the time it was going to be tough to follow 'Misplaced childhood'. I think in a way they did, it definitely is a more mature album. The subject matter is clearly almost Floydian in its tone, in that its about what the band, mostly Fish, were dealing with at the time, in the tradition of PF dealing with their difficulties on 'Wish you were here' and Waters own naval gazing on 'The wall'. It seems as though Fish's partying (though I believe he was not the only one, from later interviews) certainly was an issue within the band and formed the basis for the character of 'Torch'. 
 
It is a very strong album musically and even though I have an incredible soft spot for 'Misplaced Childhood' I think I actually prefer this album. SO many strong songs here 'White Russian' I believe is the best. However the albums atmosphere is almost its trump card, it retains a very dark feeling throughout and I think that contributes to it's strength hugely. 
 
I was VERY close to the stage at Wembley for this tour show, in fact still the closet I've ever been in an arena setting. It really was a great show and I always thought the added extra of the backing vocalist on that one tour was a smart move, she really added to the sound. 
 
In short, yeah, probably in their best three or so albums, I find it very hard to rate their work since not only is there two separate Marillion's with the SH version being a very different animal, but also their work is VERY different all over, it is a vast body of work that shows incredible diversity. You have the poppy 'Holidays in Eden', this album, 'Seasons end' (another one of their best) and 'Brave' all within 7 years. Very different albums all of them.

All exceptional prog artists, all adored by men of all walks of life. But where are all the lady fans?

When my fiancé first learned of my love of Tool, he was all too excited to introduce me to Porcupine Tree. We were riding around in his old single cab pick up, and then Wedding Nails began to play. My first reaction was to say, ""I'm not the biggest fan of purely instrumental music."" He didn't even acknowledge that comment, and I'm so happy for that. By the end of that song, and further, the end of the album, I was totally hooked. I couldn't get enough of Steven's ingenious lyrics and instrumental compositions.

Years have passed since that day, and I've come to consider myself a bit of an asshole when it comes to music. Not purposefully, but it's hard to enjoy the new Anna Kendrick single (pretty sure she's famous for being in Twilight, but don't hold me to that) when you're so accustomed to the mind blowing drumming of Peart and his like.

I never much questioned where the prog fan girls were hiding until I met one. We had quite a bit in common. We agreed about politics, religion, and most importantly, music. And that got me to thinking: Why are there so few female prog fans? Is it just inherently masculine music? Does it not touch in most women what it does in that one fan girl and myself?

So my question is thus: If you're a guy, why do you think the music caters more to men than women? You don't typically see lady prog performers. And if you're a lady: Are you a prog fan? Why or why not? What is your opinion of the gender gap in this genre of music?

*Note*: Please be kind and respectful of all other commenters. Let's keep this civil. Also, let's keep the overly crazy feminism to a minimum. I'm all for gender equality, but much less so for gender based arguing. With that said, let the discussion begin! Sweet. I can appreciate that initiative.

Thanks If you want dark serial killer themes, I'd recommend [**Pawn Hearts**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvhtpfPvYas) by Van der Graaf Generator, their song [**Man-Erg**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T4pvPGrYZk) in particular.  

The whole album is about the good and evil in all people, as told through the stories of everday persons.  A man sick of the monotony and pointlessness of life in Lemmings, a man losing control of his sanity falling into fits of murderous rage in Man-Erg, and then in A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers, a lighthouse keeper who is contemplating suicide after decades of coldly watching people die by crashing into the shoreline or being sucked down beneath the waves.  

Given the musical themes shared between each of the songs, the album could also be interpreted as having one overarching story involving one person, who loses his sanity and becomes a serial killer, with the lighthouse keeper story being an allegory for the good ""angelic"" side being forced to watch helplessly as the evil side murdered people, before the good side puts a stop to it by committing suicide so that no more harm is done.",Pawn Hearts,Van der Graaf Generator,81.81818181818183,60.0,"['gothic themes', 'organs and other instruments', 'musical themes shared between songs', 'overarching story involving one person']","['similar to Steven Wilson', 'similar to Porcupine Tree', 'similar to The Raven that Refused to Sing']",['reading Frankenstein in school'],"['creepy', 'dark', 'morbid', 'serial killer themes']","['underlying themes/meaning', 'gothic themes', 'concept albums', 'songs with stories of everyday persons', 'allegory for good and evil']","['album about the good and evil in all people', 'songs depict stories of monotony, murderous rage, and contemplation of suicide']","[['Pawn Hearts', 'Van der Graaf Generator'], ['Man-Erg', 'Van der Graaf Generator']]","The album explores the good and evil in all people through stories depicting monotony, murderous rage, and contemplation of suicide, while sharing a musical theme across songs and an overarching story involving one person.

The music was beautiful and the vocalists all has amazing performances. Concept, story, and lyrics were amazing as well and cant wait to listen to this again. What album by them should I listen to next? I'm a huge fan of Ayreon, I listen Arjen's 01011001 since 2008 and actually I know most of his albums from the beginning to the end.
I started with 01, It's an amazing album since it gives you a story that, mixed with the music, It's awesome. Age of Shadows, Fifth Extinction (Dinosaurs extinction), and Sixth Extinction (Human Extinction) are my most favorite songs of the album.
Then I've listened The Theory of Everything, on 2014, that I hated it so much the first time I heard it. I remember thinking ""omg this guy only did 01 then nothing else"" but after a week, I started listening to it again and It blown my mind. It turned to be the best album I've ever heard.
Then I tried Into the Electric Castle that was marvelous for me. It was the perfect mix between the classical Prog (like yes) and the prog metal that we actually well know. My favorite songs of it are Isis and Osiris, Amazing Flight, Time beyond Time (I love this one), Garden of Emotions, Cosmic Fusion, Mirror Maze and Another Time, Another Space.
Then I went for Actual Fantasy, which is a cool album with amazing tracks, like Back on Planet Earth, Computer Eyes, The Dawn of Man.
Then I tried the Dream Sequencer, which is a great album but with less metal. And the Druids turn to Stone gives me goosebumps. I tried on that time to listen the Part 2 of the album as well, but I couldn't. Flight of the Migrator is heavier, more like Star One (that I will talk of it latter). 
Followed up, by The Human Equation which was the less attractive for me since It was too aggressive, but when I discovered that the story of the album was involving The Forevers, I paid more attention on it and actually It's a good album for me. Bit overrated, but Day 3: Pain, Day 11: Love, Day 20: Confrontation are insanely good to be real.
Then, I started digging on Arjen Lucassen solo albums, and I got in love with Lost in the New Real from the first time I saw and hear it.
To be over, they released with Anneke, an album called ""Gentle Storm"", which is nice, but Anneke's voice is a bit repetitive, since we on Ayreon are hearing voice changes and actors most of the times in the same song.
Star One and Flight of the Migrator are another genere of music, more heavier, Arjen calls it ""Space Metal"". If you want to try some of this albums you can start with Two Plus Two Equals Five, The Eye of Ra, Ayreon - Chaos, To the Quasar...
Oh btw, I was forgiving about Guilt Machine. It's very nice, a bit lighter than Space Metal songs. My favorites of Guilt Machine album are Twisted Coil and Season of Denial.
If you want to start with something, I suggest you again ""Into the Electric Castle"". If you enjoy listening prog, this could be the best option.

On the topic of Steve Hillage though, he was an original member of Gong. Just before Gong he released an album called ""Space Shanty"" with a group called ""Khan"".  This album is less jazzy than Gong, less Spacey than his albums with the S Hillage Band, and almost a little more Rockin' but still very unique and out there...

has anyone here seen them live recently? Eh, maybe.  Depends on how big of a fan you are.  Here's a review I did of the show they put on this year (saw them in August):

Lineup - Overall was impressed. Yes' Ship of Theseus style of piecing together a lineup was largely a success, with one exception I'll address later. The lead singer actually made me forget about Jon Anderson for a while. He was nails. The new bass player is actually a former Yes guitarist in a previous incarnation. He nailed the Squire sound and while not the same, he really handled the low-end well. Steve Howe was, as usual, a god on guitar. Alan White sounds like he's lost a step on drums but was solid. Which leaves Geoff Downes on keyboards, who was kind of a disappointment. Solos were mediocre, certain parts were missing, just not very inspiring. Was expecting more considering he was good when I saw them in 2011.

The setlist was really well put together. 90 minutes of music filled by 11 songs, no true 'epics' but they did a good job of picking some of the more expansive pieces like Siberian Khatru (love that bassline). Good mix of the old and the new(er), too, including their cover of Paul Simon's 'America' and Tempus Fugit, an underrated gem from their 1980 Drama album.

Highlights: Steve's guitar solo. He can still rattle off the fast counterpoint on 'Clap'. The new lead vocalist filled out the high harmonies on 'I've Seen All Good People' which I always missed when I saw them play with Jon Anderson. They didn't play anything from Fragile or the Yes Album until the second half of the set, instead focusing on the lesser known tunes.

Interesting moment - The band came back out to play an encore (Starship Trooper) and the guitar tech (who was tearing down gear) gave Steve his electric back, but did not roll back out the mounted acoustic that he uses on some songs. About 2 bars before the middle section of Starship Trooper, he realizes he doesn't have the acoustic guitar (which he plays in the middle section), so he starts making hilarious gestures and finally gets the tech's attention. Tech goes ""oh shit!"" and rolls the acoustic out just in time for Steve to switch to it before the bridge vocals begin. I bet Steve kneecapped that tech when the show was over.

Verdict - Not as good as when I saw them in '02 or '08, but considering the circumstances AND the short notice in which Sherwood got up to speed on bass, It's forgivable. Besides, seeing them one more time was worth not getting to sleep till 12:30. 7.5/10",Siberian Khatru,Yes,66.66666666666666,83.33333333333334,"['lead singer nailed the vocals', 'new bass player nailed the Squire sound', 'Steve Howe was a god on guitar', 'Alan White was solid on drums', 'Geoff Downes on keyboards was disappointing', '90 minutes of music filled by 11 songs', 'good mix of the old and new songs', 'guitar solos were fast counterpoint', 'setlist was really well put together']","[""Yes' lineup is like Ship of Theseus style"", 'Steve Howe still performs like a guitar god']","['seeing Yes live in 2016', 'seeing them one more time was worth not getting to sleep till 12:30']","['making hilarious gestures when realizing acoustic guitar was missing', ""enjoyed the high harmonies on 'I've Seen All Good People'""]",[],"['saw them in August 2016', 'former Yes guitarist now on bass', ""drummer Alan White sounds like he's lost a step on drums"", ""setlist included cover of Paul Simon's 'America'"", 'Tempus Fugit is from their 1980 Drama album']","[{'song': 'Siberian Khatru', 'artist': 'Yes'}, {'song': ""Paul Simon's America"", 'artist': 'Yes'}, {'song': 'Tempus Fugit', 'artist': 'Yes'}, {'song': ""I've Seen All Good People"", 'artist': 'Yes'}, {'song': 'Starship Trooper', 'artist': 'Yes'}]","Seeing Yes live in August 2016, especially with a setlist that included a cover of Paul Simon's 'America' and songs from their 1980 Drama album, was worth not getting to sleep till 12:30.

Even great bands had bad years. Almost every successful prog act had an album that made you say, ""What in the actual hell were they thinking?!?"". (I'm looking at you, Tormato...) Share some of yours below. Blergh!  I'm not sure if I can put it into words, really . . . .

For the sake of explanation, I was born in 1984 and grew up with a father who was a Yes fan, so Yes became a major part of my childhood.  I remember personally getting into Tormato sometime during high school (I vaguely remember borrowing my dad's Tormato cassette tape and listening to it in walkman as I went from class to class), which is about the year 2000-ish.  For whatever reason, that album really clicked with me right then and I've loved (most) of it's music ever since.

It's also worth noting that I'm more a rock guy than an ambient/space-y stuff guy (I grew up with Styx, Boston, and Journey as well!), so the songs I like most are the ones full of energy and power, like Future Times/Rejoice, Release Release, and Silent Wings of Freedom.  I also find Arriving UFO and Circus of Heaven decent, in a weird/surreal kind of way.  Like pleasant little short stories that are memorable for their quaintness.  Don't Kill the Whale hasn't aged well for me.  I think I liked it more when I was high school, but over time, I've grown tired of it.  And I consider Madrigal and Onward to be kind of filler.  Not awful, but they're not why I listen to the album.

Tormato was certainly an album where Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman do kind of take a back seat to things as we're introduced to the power trio that is Howe, White, and Squire, which is much of the appeal of Drama, in my opinion.  Sure, Wakeman adds interesting flourishes, and Anderson's vocals soar over everything as usual, but it's easy to speculate that they aren't quite as invested as the other members.

Tormato is certainly not one of Yes' best efforts as an album.  It *might* make my Top 10, depending on my mood.  Perhaps if you tried to hear it as a transition album, a proto-Drama, if you will, as they give the 70s one last shot before moving into the 80s, you might find some great stuff on there.  For what it's worth, Silent Wings of Freedom has never left my iPod (my personal standard of whether or not a song is great), and Future Times/Rejoice and Release Release have gotten on a few times as well.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that's my take on it, I guess.

Frank Zappa's rock/blues/jazz/fusion album.  Not as insane as some (most) of his other work, but considered one of his best nonetheless.

####Potential Discussion Questions:

* The final and, perhaps, the best of the *Mother of Invention*, this album rocks hard as hell.  Particularly in a Blues tempo.  How do we like this amalgamation of American jazz and blues styles combined with the very British progginess?

* How would you personally rate the album?

* Are there any moments on the album you consider particularly strong or particularly weak (i.e., favourite/least favourite moments)?

^contributions, ^comments ^&amp;amp; ^corrections ^are ^welcome.  ^Message ^/u/BenBenBenBe. I absolutely love this album.

It's one of Zappa's masterpieces, much like *Joe's Garage* or *Hot Rats*. The writing, performances, everything is just superb.

Standout moments -- Zappa's guitar solo in ""Inca Roads,"" Johnny 'Guitar' Watson's cowboy R&amp;B vocals in ""Andy"" and ""San Ber'dino,"" the piano performance in ""Pajama People,"" both an instrumental and vocal arrangement of ""Sofa,"" the vocal hijinks in ""Florentine Pogen,"" and the overall mix is flawless.

I can, and probably will, fanboy this album for **hours**.

The Zappa Plays Zappa tour came through last year and the band performed *OSFA* [in its entirety](http://m.imgur.com/dVQcxyb), and it was **magical**.

Today, I bought the following records:

* Breathless (Camel)
* Pictures At An Exhibition (Emerson, Lake, and Palmer)
* Tarkus (Emerson...)
* The Missing Piece (Gentle Giant)
* Stormwatch (Jethro Tull)

These are bands I've heard referred to as classic/essential prog, but have never checked out. Right now I have Pictures At An Exhibition playing and it's crazy. I hear its influences in bands I already know. I also like the singer's voice. My only other dive below entry prog was King Crimson, you know which one. It was...quite interesting. I've also read that The Missing Piece is NOT the Gentle Giant album to start with, but that's all they had and it was $2.

What do you think about the albums I got? Tarkus is such a good album, one of my favorite prog albums. I don't care what anyone else says about the album art, it's unique and fantastic! I hope to frame the album on my wall someday. So I think you made a great choice there. I got it for a dollar at Half Priced Books, was so psyched to find it.

Quite a lengthy read coming up, but eh.

Elements I love in progress:

* As a bass player, the Rickenbacker sound greatly pleases me and is always a plus
* Metal and instrumentals, but no strong screaming
* I'm weak for concept albums
* Long songs too
* As long as it doesn't have screaming, I'll probably be able to get into it

I'm a huge fan of Rush, Dream Theater, Genesis, and Pink Floyd. My top two current favorites of theirs are:

Rush: Clockwork Angels and A Farewell To Kings (although Hold Your Fire may be tied for second).

Dream Theater: Systematic Chaos (I've had ITPoE and TDEN on repeat today) and SFAM

Genesis: Selling England By The Pound (specifically The Cinema Show) and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (complex story telling is a plus)

Pink Floyd: Meddle (I saw a tribute band on Saturday and they did a fucking AMAZING version of Echoes, I seriously almost cried of sheer joy after it) and Animals.

___
As for other prog, this is what I've been listening to over the past few months:

* Her Halo by Teramaze (lesser known, but fucking amazing)
* Tarkus by ELP (I have it on at this second)
* Thick As A Brick by Jethro Tull (listened to this for the first time last night, fucking great, awesome drumming)
* SF Sorrow by The Pretty Things (I listened to this for the first time today too, and it's absolutely wonderful)
* Tommy by The Who (I've returned to this recently, but I was ***in love*** with this album/movie when I was little)
* The Mountain by Haken (This album is a classic, my favorite song is either Atlas Stone or Cockroach King)
* Every album by Coheed And Cambria (I saw these guys recently and that's what largely started my fandom, Good Apollo is probably my favorite album because of The Willing Well)

Ian Paice's jazz-tinged drum fills
Jon Lord's smokey, occasionally trippy, often barking organ
Ian Gillan's powerful voice (made me ruin my voice before puberty BTW)
Ritchie Blackmore's melodic, fluid playing

jazzy playing
fluid, organic guitar
smokey organ
psychedelic sounds (those organ sounds at the start of Lazy definitely fit the bill)

Mann Alive - Manfred Mann's Earth Band

Every week, on every cartrip we listened to a beat-up cassette of this.

It is a fantastic bridge between the proggy side of their music and the poppy side. Here both sides melt together into this amazing, united sound where each side is always augmented (not cheapified) by the other. Tasteful vocal tag-team on Father Of Day, lengthy intro to Martha's Madman, etc.

This is the genesis of me even having any taste in music.

Bark Psychosis - ///CODENAME:dustsucker (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYeQUec45rw)

Certainly my favorite off of *Spirit of Eden*.  So many things I love about Talk Talk; I think they can be viewed as a progressive band.  The 'deconstruction' of Talk Talk from synthpop to simple organic post-rock was such a counter-trajectory to most of their contemporaries.  Their early synthpop carved out a niche for them as a pop group, but IMO they took off when their simpler, catchy and more mature *Colour of Spring* material was sophisticated, timeless pop void of the cheesier bits of synth.  

Onward into *Spirit of Eden* and *Laughing Stock*, on which the band did more and more of what they wanted to do than ever, stripping away the music to its organic core, creating minimal soundscapes with little vocal intrusion.  *Laughing Stock*  particularly could be listened to by this sub, a highly atmospheric listen.  It's ethereal, slow burning, meditative post rock with organic instrumentation and very tasteful, minimally employed vocals.  Creates a relaxed vibe which I recommend for late night drives or a darkened room.  One step further is vocalist/primary songwriter Mark Hollis's solo album which followed *Laughing Stock* and is in that same vein of very minimal, largely instrumental music.

I could go on for a long time about Talk Talk.  A handful of years back I discovered their catalog beyond their singles, it got me super into their later albums, and led me to find Bark Psychosis, a spiritually similar band to their post-rock material.

Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of the War of the Worlds. [Here is the first track off that album.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFfZFvvuXWc) Great concept and execution, and sounds fantastic.

When I was a little toddler and a bit older, my mother would put this LP on and I'd sit in front of the stereo mesmerized while looking through the book that came with the vinyl. 

You've only heard the first King Crimson album, so I'll recommend some later albums too like Red or Lark's Tongues in Aspic.

Okay, so I have two albums I'd love to point out here. 

The first is **Ocean by Eloy**, which is basically a concept album about the rise and fall of Atlantis. It's very moody and atmospheric, and the bass parts are some of my personal favorites in prog.  The music on this album feels space-y and otherworldly while at the same time feeling mysterious, ancient, and unknown; the pinnacle of psychedelic/space rock in my opinion. Also the final track of the album, Atlantis' Agony, creates some of the most apocalyptic imagery in prog; the constant, pounding, agonizing dread combined with that haunting spoken word segment is really something to behold. This is my third favorite album of all time. 

The second album I'd like to point out is **Si On Avait Besoin D'une Cinquieme Saison by Harmonium**. This a concept album about seasons, with the first four tracks being about spring, summer, autumn, and winter respectively. The song about autumn, Depuis L'automne is one of my personal favorites, with an acoustic guitar and mellotron part towards the middle of the track that form one of the best themes in prog rock.  The final track, Histoires Sans Paroles (Stories Without Words), is a magical 17 minute epic about an imaginary fifth season. Everything on this track feels as natural as nature, with the track consistently changing moods and soundscapes so subtlety it requires multiple listens to pick up on all of them; even more peculiar is that the track really doesn't have a climax, it just comes and goes out of thin air. This album is the ultimate combination of symphonic and folk prog, and it also has no percussion parts to speak of. This album is really one of a kind and is my second favorite album of all time. 

I would highly suggest both of these albums to anybody who hasn't yet had the pleasure of listening to them!

Okay, so I have two albums I'd love to point out here. 

The first is **Ocean by Eloy**, which is basically a concept album about the rise and fall of Atlantis. It's very moody and atmospheric, and the bass parts are some of my personal favorites in prog.  The music on this album feels space-y and otherworldly while at the same time feeling mysterious, ancient, and unknown; the pinnacle of psychedelic/space rock in my opinion. Also the final track of the album, Atlantis' Agony, creates some of the most apocalyptic imagery in prog; the constant, pounding, agonizing dread combined with that haunting spoken word segment is really something to behold. This is my third favorite album of all time. 

The second album I'd like to point out is **Si On Avait Besoin D'une Cinquieme Saison by Harmonium**.

I was thinking about this yesterday when talking to someone on this sub about Beardfish. I was mentioning that I thought perhaps Beardfish's string of: 

1. The Sane Day
2. Sleeping in Traffic Part 1 
3. Sleeping in Traffic Part 2

...were the strongest set of three consecutive albums of the bands that I really enjoy. There are some other close ones, but I'm curious what you guys would pick as your three?  If Steven Wilson works for you, then his first three solo albums are a pleasure. 

Insurgentes, Grace for Drowning, and The Raven that Refused to Sing, and they fulfill everything I would need from a three album set from the same artist.

I love all three. I listen to them while reading. I listen to them because they feature a strong emotional connection to me. I listen to them because they're complex and each album and song says something different. I listen to them to share the beautiful music videos from the Raven with friend. I'm somewhat baffled how he managed to pull together those magnificent artists to create those. I listen to them because I don't get tired of it.

Phideaux and Genesis were already mentioned :D, so I'll take the ""other"" set that clicks with me on a personal level.

For me, those four Beardfish albums have about 2.5 albums worth of stuff I like, but another 1.5 albums of stuff that I always skip out on. For Änglagård, there is at least one song per album I'm not fond of. For Yes, Némo, Solaris, and so many for, it's the same story. Some non trivial part of the album doesn't do it for me.

For me it is definitely King Crimson after ITCOTCK.  Red and Larks Tongues in Aspic are especially highly regarded, and I just can't get into it at all.  Both albums to me sound badly produced and just lack any ""epic"" prog sound. Growing up in the late 70s/early 80s, Rush was pretty much unavoidable on the radio stations in the northeast of the US. Which was fine: I liked the stuff they played on the radio, but despite loving Genesis and Yes, never really bothered going much deeper with Rush than the radio cuts, although I liked their album covers. (God, remember just spending hours in the record store, studying album covers? Man, I miss that...) 

It's only in the past few years, since seeing Beyond the Lighted Stage three or four times, that I finally decided to investigate Rush, in part because Geddy and Alex just seem like such awesome guys.

As an avid teenage Rush fan I was enraptured with just how much of a discography I had the chance to explore.  By the time I was 16 I owned Caress of Steel (I first heard the album when I was 12. Can you imagine a 12 year old listening to The Fountain of Lamneth and appreciating it? It also laid the groundwork for my enjoyment of Genesis and Yes later on). I also owned AFTK, Hemispheres, Moving Pictures, 2112 and a few ""greatest hits"" albums. I listened to them on repeat almost constantly, as if I was trying to catch the music in my mind as one might try and catch an elusive butterfly in a net.

I did not own Moving Pictures however,  having heard TSOR and Freewill on other compilation albums, I knew it was going to be good. It was almost as if I was waiting for something special to happen, so I could mark my first listen through with something noteworthy. I knew that I'd only get one chance to listen to the music for the first time.  For my 16th birthday I had asked for Rush tickets to R30,  and not only did my parents deliver but they got me into the third row, right smack in front of Lerxst Lifeson himself. I couldn't wait, so I spoiled the setlist for myself, and saw that they would play  Natural Science. Why not mark my first listen with a live show? 

When I finally heard it, I adored it immediately. It weaved the atmospheric energy of pieces like Cygnus X-2 with powerfully raw bass lines that were reminiscent of Rush's earlier work, like A Passage to Bangkok. 

During the transition from the march-like rhythm to the section that goes, ""Science like nature, must also be tamed, with a view towards it's preservation"", something moved from deep within me,  I got goosebumps and started crying. The entire live experience was flowing through me, and echoing back with a swell of overwhelming emotion. 

There have been other times in my life when I felt this way---choir practices when a hauntingly dissonant section of music (Libby Larssen anyone?)  resolves perfectly, or when I came to understand a piece of music that eluded me for the first few listens. 

Anyways, this song is special to me, and I think is some of Rush's best work. Their music really filled a void in my younger life as I came to develop my overall tastes. Thanks for posting!

His work is very diverse and big, which means it can be intimidating to get into. This guide is written with fans of prog rock in mind, and this focus on the work that would most likely appeal to them. It's based entierly on my own criterias and taste, it's not an attempt at an ""objective"" guide.

I did not include any orchestral or synclavier works in this guide. Nor any post-humous releases.

I've also divided the guide into two sections: ""albums"" and ""bits and pieces"". ""Albums"" are just that - albums that prog rock fans should be able to enjoy in their entierty more or less. ""Bits and pieces"" are songs and numbers from albums that may not appeal to prog fans in their entierty (i.e albums that are mostly focused on novelty tunes), but should not go unmissed.

Again, I really want to stress that this is my guide, so try not to freak out (no pun intended) too much over any disagreements you may have.

Feel free to make a Spotify list out of this of you want to!

-------------------------
&gt;***ALBUMS***

**Lumpy Gravy**

Fantastic album, but not a good entry point. Very avant-garde.

**Uncle Meat**

Actully a soundtrack for a movie FZ &amp; The Mothers were working on at the time, but works as a stand alone album. It's farily avant-garde and features mostly complex instrumental compositions. Fair warning, all of the CD releases of this album has ""bonus"" tracks in form of a 40 min long audio excerpt from the film and an '80s rock song. They're terrible additions and completely ruin the flow of the album. The recently released ""**Meat Light**"" has the entire original album in its original mix on CD1. It's available on Spotify.

**Hot Rats**

An absolute jazz-fusion classic, and one of the first works within the genre. Slick grooves, hungry playing and beautiful melodies. Aside from FZ, Ian Underwood's contributions on the album is significant.

**Burnt Weeny Sandwhich**

Starts and ends with a couple of doo-woop numbers, but the rest is instrumental. Both composed and improvised/jammed material, a lot of it recorded live. Like Uncle Meat, it has an avant-garde feel to it. ""Little House I Used To Live In"" is just... wow. The piano intro is one of my all time favorite pieces by FZ. Absolutely sublime.

**Weasels Ripped My Flesh**

Sister album to the above one, but even heavier emphasis on improvs and jams. Also mostly recorded live.

**Waka/Jawaka**

Sort of a sequel to ""Hot Rats"", but with a big band this time around which affects both the compositions and arrangements.

**The Grand Wazoo**

Another big band album. If you like the previous one, you will like this one.

**Over-Nite Sensation**

One of Frank's most popular and also accessible albums. Some people think it's too simplistic, but there's nothing wrong with that in this case. Some of the arrangements and other bits and pieces are still very musically sophisticated. Besides, the tunes themselves are fantastic. Think of it as a prog-pop album and enjoy. One of the funkiest albums along with Roxy.

**Apostrophe**

Very much a continuation of the style on the previous album, so if you liked that one you will like this too. Has the famous ""Don't Eat the Yellow Snow"" suite.

**Roxy &amp; Elsewhere**

Problary the funkiest FZ album along with ""Over-Nite Sensation"", mostly thanks to George Duke. The ""Echidna's Arf-&gt;Don't You Ever Wash That Thing?"" combo is worth the admission price alone. Live album.

**One Size Fits All**

A fan favorite. Contains a good mix between progy songs like ""Inca Roads"" and ""Sofa"" with blues oriented songs like ""Po-Jama People"". There's also ""Florentine Pogen"" and ""Andy"" which aren't necissarily obvious ""prog songs"", but not that it matters because they're both great.

**Zappa In New York**

Another album that's a mix of styles. Worthwhile it because of the instrumentals and jam tunes. Another live album.

**Studio Tan**

This is strictly speaking not a Zappa album since he neither produced it or aproved of it. What happened was that FZ got into a conflict with his record company (Warner Bros) and they ended up releasing this and the follow up album on their own initative. Despite this, it's a very listenable album with some great pieces on it.

**Sleep Dirt**

The other of the albums not approved by FZ, but also quite good. It's entierly instrumental (unless you get the Ryko CD-version, which has redunant vocal versions of some of the tunes). ""The Ocean is the Ultimate Solution"" is a real highlight.

**Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar**

The title is no exaggeration - this album is all guitar playing by FZ and nothing else. Frank was quite an ambitious and accomplished guitar player, which this album shows. He preferd to improvise his solos and his playing is rather introspective and abstract, and it was not unusual that his solos lasted between 5-10 mins (!). This however means that this album isn't for everyone; listen to the first few numbers and see if you get it. 

**Guitar**

A follow up to ""Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar"". Listen to this if you want more of FZ's guitar playing, stay away otherwise. This album is however less of a production than the preceding one and is essentially just compilation of solos recorded live slapped togheter.

**You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol.2**

Recorded in Helsinki, Finland in 1974. Mostly the same band and material as Roxy &amp; Elsewhere, so if you like that one you will love this.

**You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol.5**

Don't bother with CD1, it's CD2 where it's at. Mostly recorded in Vienna, Austria in 1982. One of FZ's best and tightest bands ripping through mostly instrumental compositions with super confidence. FZ's guitar playing isn't exactly shabby either.

**The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life**

A compliation of songs from the 1988 tour, which would be FZ's last. Highlight is the One Size Fits All-medley.

**Make A Jazz Noise Here**

Another live album from the 1988 tour. This one has even more emphasis on instrumentals and jams than the previous one.

**Ahead Of Their Time**

A live album by the original Mothers recorded in London, 1968. Worthwhile if you like them and their antics.

------------

&gt;**BITS AND PIECES**

[] = songs are part of a suite or belongs togheter.

{ = instrumental number

@ = has a guitar solo by FZ

**Freak Out!**

FZ's and The Mothes debut album. Consists mostly of doo-woop inspired numbers with some sillyness, but is still rather good.

* *Who Are the Brain Police?*
* *Help, I'm a Rock!*
* *Return of the Son of Monster Magnet*

**Absolutely Free**

* [*The Duke of Prunes*
* *Amnesia Vivace*
* *The Duke Regains His Chops*]
* *Invocation and Ritual Dance of the Young Pumkin*{
* *Brown Shoes Don't Make It* - it's been said that this is FZ's first true masterpiece, and I'm inclined to agree. A mini rock opera that goes through several movements, while exploring the dirty minds of the men who makes our laws.

**Chunga's Revenge**

* *Transylvania Boogie*{@
* *Twenty Small Cigars*{ - a smooth and laidback cocktail lounge jazz number. A bit reminsicent of something that could be on the Hot Rats album.
* *The Nancy &amp; Mary Music*{@ - an exctract from a live version of ""King Kong"" with various solos by the band. George Duke's drum imiation at the end is quite amusing.
* *Chunga's Revenge*{@ - one of FZ's heavy hitters. The first solo sounds like a guitar, but is actully an alto sax played through a wah-wah pedal by Ian Underwood.
* *The Clap*{

**Fillmore East - June 1971**

* *Little House I Used To Live In*{ - lacks the wonderous piano into and doesn't really have any solos, but still worth a listen.
* [*Willie The Pimp, pt.1*@
* *Willie The Pimp, pt.2*{@]
* *Lonesome Electric Turkey*{ - Minimoog solo by Don Preston.
* *Peaches En Regalia*{

**Just Another Band from L.A.**

* *Billy the Mountain* - a 24 minute long rock opera about a mountain named Billy. Storywise it overlaps with ""Greggary Peccary"", which also happens to be a 20 minute long rock opera.

**Bongo Fury**

A live album recorded with Captain Beefheart, who does vocals on some tunes.

* *Debra Kadabra* - experimental blues song with Captain Beefheart on vocals.
* *Sam with the Showing Scalp Flat Top* - spoken word, surreal poetry by Captain Beefheart. The number is credited to him.
* *Man With the Woman Head*

**Zoot Allures**

* *Black Napkins*{@ - one of FZ's personal favorites and signature tunes. A guitar driven, jazzy tune that would deliver some of FZ's most passionate playing over the years.
* *Friendly Little Finger*{
* *Zoot Allures*{@ - another one of FZ's personal favorites and also a signature tune. Absolutely spellbinding.

**Sheik Yerbouti**

* *Rat Tomago*{@ - a guitar solo from ""The Torture Never Stops"" recorded in Berlin, 1978. A concert that David Bowie attended in order to check out and steal FZ's then guitar player and vocalist Adrian Belew.
* *Rubber Shirt*{ - an instrumental that only features bass and drums. An example of what FZ called ""xenochrony"", where tracks from two seperate performances are combined in order to produce intersting results.
* *The Sheik Yerbouti Tango*{@ - guitar solo from ""Little House I Used to Live In"". Also from the above mentioned Berlin concert.
* *Wild Love*
* *Yo' Mama*@ - the highlight of the album. Start of as funny vocal tune, but then shifts gears into a guitar solo that just keep building and building. All of it accompanied by some analog synth brass, which gives it a bit of an ELP feel.

**Joe's Garage**

This album is a concept album and a rock opera, but mostly consists of vocal oriented comedy songs. But what makes this album worthwhile is FZ's guitar playing and Vinnie Colaiuta's drumming.

* *Toad-O Line*{@ - guitar solo. The name is a play on Toto (the band).
* *Sy Borg* - very ""un-Zappa"" in terms of style and tone, but the silly lyrics gives it away. Features some very dreamlike Minimoog playing by Peter Wolf.
* *Keep It Greasy*@ - even more silly lyrics, but this song has some of the most insane drumming in the entire FZ catalog. Odd time signature extravaganza, with a FZ guitar solo on the top.
* *Outside Now*@
* *He Used to Cut the Grass*@
* *Packard Goose*@
* *Watermelon In Easter Hay*{@ - another one of FZ's personal favorites and signature tunes. This is very un-Zappa with a beautiful vamp and and an even more romantic melody. Try not to weep...

**Tinseltown Rebellion**

* *Easy Meat*@ - the lyrics to this song are undeniably misogynistic. But it has a very fun and good ""classical"" section and a guitar solo. The classical section is played with analog synth brass, reminicent of ELP (just like Yo' Mama). And in the middle, a guitar solo with FZ and Vinnie Colaiuta playing cat and mouse.
* *Now You See It - Now You Don't*{@
* *Brown Shoes Don't Make It*
* *Peaches III*{

**You Are What You Is**

* *Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear*{ - originally a guitar solo by FZ, transcribed by Steve Vai who also overdubbed the guitar part. If if I'm not misstaken, FZ is in the right stereo channel and Vai is in the left.
* [*I'm a Beautiful Guy*
* *Beauty Know no Pain*]

**Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch**

* *Drowning Witch*@ - one of FZ's best compositions from the era. Starts of with a vocal section, and then a ""sprechstimme"" section, about a witch in love with a merchant marine. It then goes into an instrumental section, which is considered to be one of the most complex pieces FZ ever wrote. After that comes two (!) guitar solos by FZ, with a short but complex bridge in the middle. Then another complex instrumental section to wrap it up. A real prog rock master piece.
* *Envelopes*{

**The Man from Utopia**

* *Tink Walks Amok*{ - a bass driven instrumental. ""Tink"" is the nickname of Arthur Barrow, who was FZ's bass player at the time and is doing the playing here. And amok does he run indeed.
* *Moggio*{ - twin piece with ""What's New In Baltimore?"". Can you hear the similarities between the pieces?
* *We are not Alone*{

**Them or Us**

* *Ya Hozna*{
* *Sinister Footwear II*{@ - another one of FZ's most complicated pieces. Hopefully we'll get an official release of the orchestral version someday, played the The Berkley Symphonic Orchestra (bootlegs are available though).
* *Marqueson's Chicken*{@
* *Them or Us*{@ - a guitar solo from ""The Black Page #2"" recorded in Italy, 1982.
* *Whipping Post*@ - FZ's cover of the Allman Brothers classic. Robert Martin doing some amazing vocals.

**Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention**

* *Alien Orifice*{@
* *What's New in Baltimore?*{@ - one of FZ's absolutely best pieces, but unfortunetly quite overlooked. That guitar solo is just so un-Zappa, in the best possible way. As mentioned above, it's musical twin with Moggio.

**Does Humor Belong in Music?**

* *Let's Move to Cleveland*{@ - the real highlight of the otherwise cheesy sounding 1984 tour. This tune offered some worthwhile solos.
* *What's New in Baltimore?* - this version suffers from the cheesy sound on this tour and a vocal section that wasn't really necessary. But a really funny ad-lib by FZ and a decent guitar solo makes it worthwhile.

**Jazz from Hell**

* *St. Etienne*{@ - guitar solo from ""Drowning Witch"" recorded in St. Etienne in France, 1982. FZ won his only Grammy for this performance.

And that's it! If you want more, you can always dig into the discography on your own. The whole ""You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore"" series is great and contains many excellent live versions of the songs mentioned here. Then there's of course all the post-humous releases, many of which are quite excellent.

[Van Der Graaf Generator - H to He Who Am The Only One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQR6e_wpeiY)

Pretty much every song on this album is about isolation and loneliness. I'd guess Killer and Lost would be especially fitting. If you like it, there's plenty of other VdGG which also fits the bill. Essentially any album between this one and World Record has at least a couple songs which fit the bill.

[Airbag - Disconnected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_AUpvBxX-A&amp;list=PL2-zYbYSDBl-W-EaPpHOL8F8KgSaBvcCk)

Another concept album about isolation and loneliness. Sorta Pink Floydish, less raw emotion than in H to He. Also less focused on love, and more on just general isolation. Not the best fit but it's what I could think of off the top of my head.

What makes it enjoyable to you?  I like it for its complexity and unpredictability--all when used appropriately. I am not a big fan of bands that do it for complexity's sake, but rather for enriching the purpose/meaning/story of the song. For example, Tony Banks is famous for his complex chord progressions and modality. The ambiguous tones always add an extra dimension to the music in my opinion. Off the top of my head, *Me and Sarah Jane*--a song from the perspective of a lonely/crazy homeless man, who fabricates a relationship between himself and the invented ""Sarah Jane"", before drowning himself (with her)--is a perfect example. The ambiguous tonality that is created from Tony's complex and constantly modulating chords implies that the homeless man is unsure of himself and a bit looney.   
 
Another example, although not necessarily progressive rock (maybe progressive pop/baroque pop) is *God Only Knows* by the Beach Boys. Like Tony Banks and other prog artists (Tony even says that the album was a great inspiration to him), Brian Wilson (genius behind the Beach Boys) uses complex chords/key shifts. The song--about losing a loved one--uses ambiguous tonality to show the sort of soul searching/restlessness/lost feel of the narrator who lost his loved one and doesn't have the will to live anymore.

It sounds like 23 minutes of unfocused rambling and random unconnected melodies and musical arrangements. The story, if there is one, is so abstract and over the top it makes Thick As A Brick look completely normal in comparison. 

If you like this song, why? What do you enjoy about it? Others on here have given a lot of good guidance about the lyrics. As far as the ""random unconnected melodies and musical arrangements,"" I see where you're coming from, but it's a bit more cohesive than that. 

Remember that this was pretty recently post-*Abbey Road*, with its brilliant Side Two medley. That opens with ""You Never Give Me Your Money,"" and then either segues or crashes or fades into other songs, which either segues or crashes or fades into other songs, and so on, with only tangential, if any, lyrical references tying them together, until that opening ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" melody comes back, ultimately with tweaked lyrics, before closing with ""The End."" 

It's one of the great rock recordings of all time and, as with *Sgt Pepper's* clearly had a large influence on Yes and Genesis. But while being a large scale work, it's not really much like a larger classical composition such as a sonata (or something which frequently uses sonata form, such as a symphony or string quartet) — there's not really one main and one secondary melody (or themes) which get developed and played with and altered before ultimately coming back around. There's the opening melody which is brought back at the very end, which ties the entire thing together, but in between it's just an assortment of odds and ends, bits and bobs. Being the Beatles, each of those are minor gems, but it's their ability to string them together in the right order — which wasn't the original order, so it's not like they just tossed them together — and, of course, their sound, which makes it all hang together. I mean, even apart from the obvious familiar and magnificent sound of John and Paul singing, Ringo's drums have a ton to do with how the entire thing feels cohesive, even before his drum solo. 

So. ""Supper's Ready"" is similar musically, and has a not entirely dissimilar origin. The *Abbey Road* medley began, in part, because they had all these little ideas, and rather than work them up into finished songs, they decided to keep them in their embryonic stages and string them together to form a larger piece. If I remember my history correctly, ""Supper's Ready"" came about in a similar way. Many of the ideas had been floating around for years in various form, and finally coalesced into the version we know now, rather than having been composed that way originally. 

[Wiki tells us] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supper's_Ready):

&gt; Nearly 23 minutes in length, the song is divided into seven sections. A number of musical and lyrical themes do re-appear throughout. The melody of the verse in section I reappears as a flute melody between sections II and III. The melody of the chorus in section I reappears with new lyrics in the coda to section VI. The song that comprises the majority of section II reappears briefly in instrumental form at the beginning of section VI, and then returns to form the body of section VII, with new lyrics.

""Supper's Ready"" has the ""and it's, hello, babe, with your guardian eyes so blue"" melody in the opening section, which doesn't come really obviously come around again until almost all the way at the very end of the piece. And in between are all those other sections, some of which flow from one to another, and some of which have very deliberately jarring breaks or introductions, depending upon which mood the band was going for.

Again, others have given some lyrical readings. I'd suggest, as a way to get a handle on it musically, you think of it as a car journey, but one which goes on a loop, rather than a ""there and back"" trip. So you start at home and travel through various locales, and small towns and big cities and horrific wastelands, most of which are completely unlike what's come before, but some of which you start to realize have surprising familiarity while still being at the same time foreign, before ultimately coming back home, although home seems a bit different now: changed yet comforting.

I'd suggest listening to it a few more times, letting some of the more whimsical moments seep in, and revel in the pounding apocalypse which leads to its climax. Maybe pay special attention to the fantastic drumming of Mr Phil Collins, and the way his vocals blend so wonderfully with Peter Gabriel's.

It's us, James and Tolni, once more here to bring you reviews of King Crimson albums. Well, ""reviews"", as far as musical stuff and crackpot theories about Peter Sinfield lyrics can be called such. Next up is *Lizard*. 

**James**: A hodgepodge of silly lyrics, analog synthesizers, and meticulously crafted solos, *Lizard* is quite the record. Accompanied by quite turbulent recording sessions, the lineup features drummer Andy McCulloch, bassist and singer Gordon Haskell, and woodwinds expert Mel Collins, along with half a dozen studio musicians, including a guest vocal from Jon Anderson of Yes fame. It also features the namesake of the album, King Crimson’s longest song, a multi-part fantasy epic. While different from previous albums and anything that would come after it, it retains the overall King Crimson sounds, while Fripp takes a backseat to the other sonic elements. Another thing to note about the album is the insanely detailed cover done by Gini Barris, which might be one of if not my favorite King Crimson album cover.

**Tolni**: *Lizard* is an interesting album. It's a departure from the overall style of the past two albums, opting out for a more jazzy feel and ditching the mellotrons. There's also a change in lineups, as Greg Lake quits (**NOOO!**) King Crimson, to create the prog rock superband, *Emerson, Lake, Palmer*. Good on him. He's replaced with Gordon Haskell, of *Cadence &amp; Cascade* fame in the previous album. The creation of this album's been something of a *clusterfuck*, so as to say. The main issue came from, well, Fripp being Fripp, who stressed out various session players and musicians present. Furthermore, there was a certain conflict between Haskell and Sinfield, due to the latter's penchant for more...esoteric and off-the-wall lyrics, which was in a direct opposition with Haskell's desire to sing more blues-inspired songs, and often found SInfield's lyrics to be ludicrous. This creative difference later on led to the departure of Haskell, who himself joined on the King Crimson gig only to get money.

Fripp, as time passed, has derided his album, going as far as to [call it out](http://ultimateclassicrock.com/king-crimson-lizard/). Nevertheless, it remains quite the achievement, an attempt into blending both rock and jazz into one whole. The results are here to be seen...

# Cirkus

**James**: Opening with a duet of electric pianos in E Minor, *Cirkus* is a rather somber album opener. Haskell’s vocals float on top of the arpeggiating keyboards, oscillating between D and E, rising at the end of each phrase. As the drums barrel in at the end of the verse, a haunting mellotron (the same setting used on The Devil’s Triangle?), oscillating between Bb and G, rising occasionally to the tritone E. Overall, the arpeggiated mellotron chord lines up to be E diminished, giving the section the overall haunting feel with two minor 3rds stacked atop one another. 

The song continues as Fripp joins in on arpeggiated acoustic guitar (lots of arpeggios in the song huh), and the texture thickens with a heavier bass guitar line, including the tritonal Bb-E. With a shout, the central riff leads into the first solo, a flowing triplet line that creates a clashing 3/2 rhythm. The next verse plays similarly, with a swirling guitar figure giving the phrase a slightly more chaotic feel. A lengthy saxophone solo enters, leading to a sparse verse missing drums. The piece builds once more, and gets quiet suddenly, throwing the listener off. 

As the piece concludes, dissonance takes over as the volume builds. Several solos occur, the last of which being a cornet outlining a chromatic tritonal scale minus the A#, moving from A-D#. Under this, the bass guitar revolves around tritonal jumps as well, referencing the initial tritones in the brass feature. Overall, the minor and diminished arpeggios along with the tritones giving the piece a very swirling, *cirkusy* feel, while still remaining sinister.


**Tolni**: *Cirkus*. One of my favourite tracks on this album, it's a bit of a weird song, at least lyrically. (You're gonna hear this a lot in this album and in the next.) It starts off with birth; the beginning of the lyrical speaker, introduced all in the first verse, with the soft voice of Haskell telling us how he was born. As the verse goes on, his voice's strength increases. He is sent into the Cirkus. A one-time visit there, which would change his life forever, as he sees the true chaos and absurdity that is the Cirkus.

In the next verse, we see how he's getting there, as he's directly plopped into the Cirkus, following a payment. It is loud and chaotic, and then we meet the Ringmaster, who runs everything around there. He invites him to the parade, where on display are most of of the social classes and occupations. Then, in the next verse, a not-so-subtle dab at TV and its shallowness, as a clown speaks out how they should worship him as he's a TV. At the parade, there's a band and there's police and high society women. Afterwards, there's the strongmen guarding the next batch of people coming in, the politicians. They are 'skillful in their lies, as they acrobatically juggle with lies and truth, and with the help of mirrors they hide their true selves and agendas…

But this parade is all of a sudden broken down, as chaos breaks out. The elephant (a stand-in for the normal people, those not present in the parade, constantly caged) after being force-fed stale chalk for years, eats through the cages and rampages through the Cirkus. The strongmen are fleeing, and there's new forces - the lions - have arised on the Cirkus's stage to take advantage of the rage of the elephants. All hell's let loose, and even the lyrical speaker is fleeing for his life, only to be greeted out on the way out that this is how it is and how it should be. Just fun in the Cirkus!

I love this song. It's very...erratic. One person I showed this song commented that it is as if there's five or more melodies, all going together at once, always dissonant. I must agree, and James's part of the review will likely prove that. It's what makes it so special, in the end; this feeling of multifacetedness that reality has, the lack of a single unified feeling. It's great.

# Indoor Games

**James**: If you liked the indulgent solos of the last song, boy oh boy will you love *Indoor Games*! The first appearance of Sinfield’s VCS3 Synthesizer, the sound of the song is a far departure from much else King Crimson had done. Sure, the saxes are familiar, but the synth is completely out of left field. But somehow, it fits! The overall theme of the album, both with recording sessions, sound, and lyrics, is strangeness. While an odd choice musically, the synth fits the atmosphere set up by the other odd things going on in the mix. 

Getting on to the actual music, the piece is in the key of G. The first note the saxophones hit is an A-C# major third, which seems happy. It is, in fact, until you add in the Eb in the bari sax, making it an A(b5) chord, something often found in jazz. While it sounds dissonant and weird standalone, the song moves the opening line and the odd chord becomes part of the melody. Unfortunately, it’s not my job to make heads or tails of the lyrics, *since I can’t*. Because of this, I can’t tell you if the music evokes the emotion of the lyrics, but I can tell you what the music does evoke. Under the vocal line, Fripp skitters around the fretboard, giving a more intriguing backing than just quarter note chords. Even more interesting is how Fripp uses both channels of the stereo mix, and records two different guitar backings, placing one in each channel. He does this, almost, to make up for the lack of a very strong rhythm section. While Haskell can play relatively well, he’s no Lake or Wetton. McCullouch, on the other hand, is a very good drummer in my opinion. Where he falls flat, though, is his drumming seems to be a semi-wooden impression of Giles, who I’ve come to appreciate as a musician massively lately.

*Indoor Games* always felt far longer than it is, along with *Cirkus*. I think this is part due to the excessive amounts of solos in the album. And it wouldn't be King Crimson if there wasn't something weird about the solos, either. Rather than just letting the soloists play for 32 bars or so, Fripp would have them record a few bars, and then record a few more, then splice it all together. While it’s an odd practice and something a lot of the session musicians disliked, it certainly does give the solos a different feel, almost a balance between structure and improvisation. Overall, I think that *Indoor Games* is my least favorite track on the album. It’s a nice transition between *Cirkus* and *Happy Family*, but I feel it drags on too long through the solos. But speaking of...

**Tolni**: If you ever looked at King Crimson lyrics, perhaps driven by this review, and you just checked out *Cirkus*, you probably thought ""Whoa, what in the world.."". Well, if after that you wondered - could it be weirder - then, I, as the person reviewing the lyrics, am more than happy to say: Yes. It does. Oh, does it. It's kind of difficult to parse through what is the point of the lyrics, as my compatriot has noted above. Sadly, in this case, it *is* my job to literally divine what in the world they mean.  

While in other songs I spend my time deliberating, often for whole days, as to what certain lyrics mean. (The fact it doesn't show is another thing.) This time, however, I'll just go with my gut. *Indoor Games* is about *nothing*. But not ""nothing"" as in ""this song is about nothing"". No, it's about how we, as humans, seem to just loiter around. It's the inherent pointlessness of all the everyday actions we do. As I was writing this, I realised *""Oh, so it's just a trippier *Cat Food*, isn't it then?""*. And it all kinda strung together, in a way. 

Let's first begin with the name of the song, and the line that features at the end of each verse - **INDOOR GAMES**. It's a refrain that comes on and on, but to what end? Simple. It nullifies all of the actions described in the verse itself. It reduces them all to mere games, played only for the amusement of the people inside, with no point, no spirit, *nothing*. All of the unnamed characters are simply stuck in an infinite loop of banality, with no means of escape. 

Much like *Cat Food*, the tone in *Indoor Games* is derisive and disapproving. However, unlike *Cat Food*, in which the mockery is somewhat indirect, in *Indoor Games*, we see the pronoun ###### you showing up more. And the tone is much more direct. Imagine, that as you're doing your daily deeds, Peter Sinfield is staring through the window, with his unblinking eyes, and he's writing a song about how your entire life is pointless and empty of meaning. This is how *Indoor Games* must have came to be. Or drugs, but that's boring.

So, let us begin with the first verse of this theoretical voyeurism which likely never happened. It begins with the master of the house (that's you.), as he tries to impress his house staff by playing a ""game"" where you're pretending to be them, as you dust the fake garlic plants. But all that does is snickering from the house staff, as they can't take you seriously. Your next attempt to try and be ""them"" fails just as badly, as you wear nothing but your apron (armour, in the lyrics, but it'd make more sense if it means apron, yes? Yes?!), and before anything can happen; the lyrics are cut off by the **INDOOR GAMES** refrain, which ends all actions.

Next up, are your ""friends"", but the lyrics quickly show that they aren't actual friends as one might call them, who are easily amused by your puppet shows, and are not commenting on your awful recipes only because they might offend. It's all boring. And lame. All you do is lay on the sofa in your clothes. 

And this review would be about as pointless if I review each and every verse separately, so I'll just say that it follows how you slowly degenerate and become stupider and stupider, with each verse getting more and more absurd. Are you even alive? Well, not *you*, the reader, but the ###### you in the lyrics. You know, whomever Sinfield is stalking late at night. This doesn't seem like a normal life. It feels like a sickness, an almost feverish ennui, if you will. There is no meaning, no reason, *nothing*, to this life. It repeats itself about as much as this review repeats itself, except that at least Sinfield got royalties for this, at the end of the day. 

Finally, the song ends with Haskell's laughter, distorted over into a nightmarish sound. The story of this laugh is rather amusing, in fact - it was a result of the inane, almost gibberish lyrics, which he couldn't possibly take seriously. Regardless, apparently the rest of the King Crimson crew felt it's appropriate, and they included it in the song itself. And I can't deny it; it fits in well, as it's a denial of this whole absurdity, a way to be above the person we're observing, as we *clearly* are doing meaningful things and our lives are full of reason and sanity and all the things that are lacking in *Indoor Games*.

Right?

# Happy Family

**James:** As we jump from my least favorite song to my second favorite song, *Happy Family* starts after an interlude of bizarre laughter. Sinfield’s VCS3 Synth carries the melody this time, pulsing over a dramatic descending bass line. Haskell’s vocals come in after a few repetitions, and is distorted in the strangest way, presumably through a Leslie speaker. When I first heard the song, I thought my headphones were messed up. But once I learned what the lyrics actually were, it started to settle with me more. 

I must admit, The Beatles are my favorite band of all time and I believe they will continue to be always. Their influence on King Crimson is clear in songs like this, where the entire body of the lyrics is about them, or in *Cat Food* from the previous album where *Come Together*’s bassline is echoed. Another interesting link I discovered recently is their usage of mellotron presets- the same flamenco guitar on The Beatles’ *The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill* is used in a live King Crimson performance of *Travel Weary Capricorn* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xjbk3xPdj0, found at 3:15). Fripp also says that *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* was a main influence of his early on, and that King Crimson was an attempt to combine Hendrix, The Beatles, and Stravinsky. 

The song itself is interesting musically. It teeters between 6/8 and 4/4, but the quarter note stays constant, rather than the quarter note in 4/4 switching to a dotted quarter note in 6/8. Instrumentation wise, the song is soaked in spastic electric pianos, elevator music-esque flute solos, marimba, synth, and jagged guitars. All of this nervously weaves in and out of each other, creating tension to mirror the song’s subject. There’s even Beatle-esque harmony vocals prefacing each line at times. The song comes to an end, and Haskell’s vocals are completely clean, which makes me glad they put distortion on them, as they don’t fit with the soundscape without modification. 

**Tolni**:  A fresh breath after the existentialist nightmares that were both *Cirkus* (somewhat) and *Indoor Games* (definitely), follows up *Happy Family*, a song about the Beatles. To be exact, about their breakup. By the time of the recording of this album, late 1970, the split of the Beatles was more or less plainly obvious. It isn't a surprise that there's a song on this topic, as it was something of an important event. Understatement of the century.

The first verse starts out with the line *""Happy family, one hand clap, four went by and none come back.""*, which is repeated through the song multiple times through the song. It's the main theme of the song, in the end - how the Beatles is supposedly a happy family, where everything is just okay. But the two words afterwards dispel that - how can one hand clap?! It's all a lie, an illusion. The Beatles were disunited, and there can't be a happy family if there's no unity. They're bound to split up, and never reunite. The first verse is otherwise about the various drug abuses of the Beatles, hinting about McCartney's (in this case, Judas.) LSD use, and his following advocacy of legalization of drugs, which (presumably) wasn't liked by the rest of the bandmates - hence, the *""We'll blow our own canoes""* line. The last line presumably is about all the noise made about it.

The next verse is about the Beatles' tours. One should keep in mind that *Happy Family* is by no means chronological, and it goes in and out as it wishes. Anyway, while the tours are all across the world, bringing music to everyone, it also fattens their check balances. Indeed, all seems good, but then they start to get tired of this way of life, and demand a break. It is then that the first ripples in their relationship, to which the song itself refers - *what goes round must surely spin*, as the happy faces are souring. Finally, the last line, a reference to Grip-Pipe-Thynne, a character from *The Goons Show*, a favourite of the Beatles. No, I definitely did not google this and found it in a site dedicated to King Crimson. Nope. The ""spoken"" line itself is referring to Rin Tin Tin, a world-famous dog and a superstar. It's unknown to whom it is said, but one thing means - the bandmates weren't going to be dogs, unquestioning and forever loyal. No, they couldn't bear this any longer...

(i did)

The next verse, I believe, is about the recording of the *White Album*, a notoriously messy affair, which is, in fact, what was the final step in the breakup of the Beatles. First off, Rufus (or Ringo) becomes serious, and starts to worry about the band's future (after all, of all the Beatles, he was the most liked between all three of them). Secondly, Silah's (Harrison) embrace of Hinduism, as well as introduction of various Indian instruments - most notably, the sitar. Finally, Jonah (or Lennon)'s wife, Yoko Ono, an object of controversy even then, and then Judas (or Paul)'s controlling tendencies during the production of the *White Album*, which strained his relationship with the rest of the band. And again, the line from the beginning of the song repeats, mockingly, as the band deteriorates…

The final verse sets off the post-breakup careers of everyone. After *Abbey Road* and *Let it Be*, the public isn't caring much about the performances as so much as the drama around the breakup. First off, Silas (Harrison) is searching, a reference to the eclectic, but nonetheless great album, *All Things Must Pass*. Then, Rufus (Ringo) is ""neat"", referring to his multiple appearances on projects such as *All Things Must Pass* and *Plastic Ono Band*, as well as his solo albums released in 1970. Afterwards, Jonah (Lennon) is ""caustic"", referring to his first solo album, *Plastic Ono Band*, a great album (and better than *Imagine*), which become notorious for it's brutal honesty and critique of the social order. **breathe** And finally, at least, comes up Jude (McCartney), and his album *McCartney*, which, of course, as every single McCartney album, has at least one love song. Or several. Then, at last, the song talks about a barber who will cut their hair short - a sign that rebellion is over, and now you're part of the people with the short hair. Old people. And it ends on the same note as it did. The Happy Family line. And it's over.

Jeez, and that's one long review. And that's just the third song. Anyway, I like Happy Family; it has those cool distorted vocals which make the entire song even more chaotic, and it gives a feeling of pure *wrongness*. It's also filled with tons of injokes. Whew. I still prefer *Cirkus*.


# Lady of the Dancing Water

**James:** *Lady of the Dancing Water* is a relatively simple song, similar to *Moonchild* from the debut album both in style and in placement on the album, serving as a calm before the storm of the title track. Haskell’s vocals fit nicely in with the flowing flutes and pianos, but compared to *Moonchild* something seems different. In my opinion, it’s the lack of a moving and intricate drum part, due to the lack of Giles. While the Lizard rhythm section is strong in it’s own right, the band wouldn’t be able to match the Lake/Giles duo until Wetton/Bruford/Muir on *Larks’ Tongue in Aspic*. 

But anyways, back to the album we’re reviewing at hand. *Lady of the Dancing Water* just feels bland, and while it’s a pretty song with an interesting trombone feature and a nice melody, it just doesn’t stack up to the rest of the album. Not much more to say on it. 

**Tolni:** I'm not gonna spend a lot of time here. It's mainly a filler song, giving a nice respite between *Happy Family* and the 20-minute epic, *Lizard*, from which the namesake of the album comes from. It's not bad, a calm and soft sound, echoing *Cadence &amp; Cascade* in a way, and it's clear that Haskell is much more suitable for such kind of songs, as opposed to the weird and distorted songs before. Overall, nothing much to write home about.

# Lizard

**James:** The meat and potatoes of the album, the entire second side, the namesake of the album, it is time for *Lizard*. But specifically Prince Rupert Awakens. And Bolero. And The Battle of Glass Tears. Don’t forget Big Top. 

*deep breath*

The piece begins with a fairly jarring descending glissando in some synthesized instrument, playing an E(b6)(b9), to be exact. In the first vocal line, “Farewell the temple master’s bells”, guest vocalist Jon Anderson of Yes fame sets up the recurring rhythm. This pattern reappears and makes up the bulk of the heavy section of The Battle of Glass Tears. The use of sparse instrumentation and suspended chords leads to a suspenseful opening in a minor key. Suddenly, with a transition, the key shifts from A Minor to A Major, the rhythm section wakes up, and the music switches from a downpour to a sunbreak. This pattern repeats a few times, the second time with some harsh piano accents and a hint towards the bolero rhythm in the drums. Eventually, the timpani rolls build as the snare carries the rhythmic pattern into the second movement of the song, Bolero. 

The mellotron strings have now been replaced with a cornet, and later a cor anglais, as they both solo other the span of four minutes. It’s clear throughout this where the cuts within the solo phrases are, as instruments will jump intervals that normally aren’t natural, achieving a strange, classic King Crimson sound. A jazz ensemble made up presumably of the studio musicians joins in for a few minutes, complete with atonal and piano and chirping brass, before dissipating shortly after. We hear one last cor anglais solo, stretching the instrument’s upper tessitura. 

After a brief vocal appearance by Haskell, his only on the 23 minute piece, we get into my favorite part of the piece, *The Battle of Glass Tears*. The layers of heavy woodwinds and mellotron and guitar, as well as the rhythm section, all boil up into something that truly sounds like the anthem of a battle. Fripp’s guitar soars over diminished and augmented and overall off-kilter chords, until the piece breaks down into a haunting solo by Fripp, which may be my favorite piece in the entire album. 

While I think ultimately I would’ve preferred the album end there, there’s one more bit of *Lizard* left, in *Big Top*. Interestingly enough, for a while Big Top was the working title of the album. Effectively a loop, instruments enter and exit the fray as the song alternates between two chords- G7 and C. And with that, Lizard finally concludes.

**Tolni:** And here we are, folks. What we've been waiting for. Forget the songs about meaning of life and cryptic Beatles breakup songs. The culmination of *Lizard* has finally come to us, in the form of the multi-movement suite. It even has Jon Anderson, of *Yes* fame, singing on the *Prince Rupert Awakes* portion. It's different from anything done by King Crimson until then; a *coherent* (And when we mean ""coherent"" here, it's in the sense that in order to make sense of it you don't need to be *completely* insane.) epic. One can easily say as well that it presents itself as a synthesis of the entire album, as well. 

But let's get back on track. The real meaning behind *Lizard*, much like all other songs, is obscured behind the typical Sinfield lyrics, which is to say, there's a layer of metaphors, references, in-jokes, and what-not. That being said, there's a theory about Lizard being based in the real world and draws allusions to historical events. Since there's about 10 pages of it, and the moment I started reading it, I thought I'm slowly going insane, I prefer to stick to the idea that, fundamentally, this song's about fiction. 

First off, we start off with the Prince Rupert. He leaves off to search for Eden, after a final visit to the temple. Behind him, the whole court is behind him; he's going on a noble cause. But the time has not come yet. First, he must learn more about it. And how else, if not by showing his purity - the tears of devotion for the cause, which water the ancient scrolls that reveal the location of Eden. He just needs to watch out for the Lizards...which are, well, guess who - *Satan.* The snake. The Great Deceiver. (Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Vir- wrong album.)

**(NB: The fact that I've mapped *Lizard* to Satan doesn't mean I believe this song is Satanic or is in any way related to Satanism.)**

The chorus makes this even more evident. The Lizard is the one that tempts you to do away with everything and everyone - making you burn all the bridges behind you, and abandon all that matters. To ignore one's voice of reason. And for what? Just to grab Satan by the throat? Is it worth it all the sacrifices? I can't really say if it's worth it; but Prince Rupert has sunk deep into this, with Eden. Hell's path is paved with good intentions, after all.

In the next verse, the name of Polonius is namedropped, so as to say. According to most interpretations, he's a sincere, but foolish character, who always seems to take all the bad judgements. This only reinforces the feeling that Prince Rupert is taking the wrong choice. Death is sure to come, as the reaper's being present in this verse, as well. Afterwards, it seems that he fights the Devil with...well, *corn*. I'll be fair, at the risk of coming as uneducated, but I can't make all too much sense out of this. Perhaps it means that the well-fed peasantry will resist the Devils? Who knows. Once the Devils are killed, however, they fade, and are ""reborn"" in the form of a Swan; a sign of change, that even the most irreparable beings can become good.

The final verse of the *Prince Rupert Awakes* starts out with a curious historical reference. The Courts of Piepowders would be the lowest, yet, amusingly enough, most efficient way of dealing out justice in England before the 19th century. It usually dealt with petty crimes. **ANYWAY**. It seems, that in Lizard, it serves the purposes of Satan, as it makes him and his devils sell foolish dreams to gullible folks. And, again, one of those people happens to be Prince Rupert himself, as he seeks the mystical Garden of Eden…

Then begins the next act. Originally, I disliked *Bolero – The Peacock's Tale*, the second part, as I felt it's filler and goes on for far too long, without bringing much to the table. However, now, in light of this interpretation, I find it appropriate. It tells us of the long search of Prince Rupert, far and wide, going through faraway lands. All to seek Eden.

But then! It all ends. The search is over, in a way. But the stage is set for an epic battle. Gordon Haskell gives us a grim description of the night before the battle. Two...civilizations, shall we say, meet to battle it out in an epic scenario not too unlike out of *Civilization*. The fear. The anxiety. The hopes, even. Will they secure Eden from their counterparts, who, much like them, desire this coveted land? It is unknown, at the time. The uncertainty is terrifying… 

And then it comes. The culmination of this piece. The clash of the nations happens, and neither sides seems to want to back down. Swords clash, men die, and it seems that it's not going into Prince Rupert's way. It seems he, himself has to fight on his own, in a desperate struggle. You can hear how his sword is clashing with someone else's at ~18:00. But it's too much. He's overcome, and he perishes in battle. He pays for the fact that he gave into the lies of the Lizard, with his life. There's no Eden for him, or for any mortal. The foolish dream is cut right there…

...yet, oddly enough, there *is* redemption. There's a pleasant and nice tune, at the end, as a respite of sorts after the heavy jazz instrumentation and all that in the past 20 minutes. I believe, however, that this isn't just a silly thing that Fripp &amp; Co. threw in because they thought it sounds cool. It's showing how Prince Rupert's soul ascends to Heaven. Ironically, he does reach Eden. Because, in the end, he's not a bad person. Just a misguided one. We all are, aren't we?

And that's *Lizard*, for y'all. Somehow, even this got existential. Damnit. 

# Conclusion

**James:** Normally when I finish the reviews, I’m so burnt out on the album having heard it many times over a short span. This time is no different. The album, while being very good, is an excellent album to put on in the background, as you go through the fantasy journey of synth and artificially (**T**: Demand only free-range solos from your musicians!) constructed solos. It’s got a unique sound, although what King Crimson album *doesn’t*, and is the last great King Crimson album before *Lark’s Tongue in Aspic.* Sorry *Islands*.

Speaking of, join us next time when we take a quick pit stop in the direction of bizarre before we get to *Islands*!

Ranking: 

Lizard - 9.5/10

Happy Family - 9/10

Cirkus - 8/10

Lady of the Dancing Water - 8/10

Indoor Games - 6.5/10

**Tolni:** What can I say. To finish up my thought from the intro, *Lizard* was a success. In whatever it tried to do - whether it was an abyss where rock and jazz met and coalesce into one big mess, or whatever else, it worked. It's a kaleidoscope of ""weird"" - each song bringing its own stripe of bizarreness. Where *Cirkus* presents itself as a critique of the social order, *Indoor Games* comes in swinging about nothing and everything, just to be taken away by *Happy Family*, a bizarre song about the breakup of the Beatles. And then, just as you're taking a breath as you listen to *Lady of the Dancing Water*, you're slammed down with the 20-minute epic of *Lizard*. 

In the end, it's a typical King Crimson album, isn't it? Never lets you catch a break. This one's just a bit more jazzy.

...Oh, as I was reading James' conclusion, I suddenly realised the existence of *Islands*. It's one of those things that make you realise that, no matter how much you're joking around, Robert Fripp, is also human and makes mistakes. But before that, as my ""companion"", James, said, we'll take a detour into something completely different!

Ranking: 

Cirkus - 10/10

Happy Family - 9/10

Lizard - 8.5/10

Indoor Games - 7/10

Lady of the Dancing Water - 5/10.

So, Styx released their first album since their cover album Big Bang Theory and the first original album since Cyclorama -- which was a straightforward rock album. Their last album with Dennis DeYoung seemed like it had potential to be a progier album but the band's tensions split any cohesion apart -- I'm talking about Brave New World.

The Mission is Styx's first real attempt at a progressive album since Killroy Was Here -- and I'd argue since Pieces of Eight.

I'm just giving it a first listen on my train ride to work. To be honest, I wasn't hopeful. Styx's current line-up seemed complacent to just play the hits and tour. But, I've been pleasantly surprised and I think it's been their strongest album since Paradise Theatre. There is a cohesion to this album that hasn't existed for Styx in decades.

IMO, Streangths: musicianship is top notch, harmonies are soaring -- a no brainer when it comes to Styx,  a single thought drives the album, the few ballads are more contemplative than ""Babe,"" it takes its theme serious but still has fun.

IMO, Weaknesses, the lyrics are straightforward and lack depth, some may be put off by its campy moments -- I personally think it's part of the Styx package. If you don't like Styx, this album isn't going to change your opinion of them

I wanted to post this here so I can start discussing the album in a little more depth. So, what do you all think?  I personally really enjoy it. One of the best flowing albums I've heard in quite a while. Red Storm and Locomotive really stuck out to me. Great tonal transitions (Ten Thousand Ways/Khedive).

I feel like Kansas is one of the most influential and talented prog bands out there, but it seems like no one really talks about them on this sub. They're one of my favorite bands and I'm blown away by their musicianship, live and on their albums, and ability to groove but sound really cohesive and every member of the band is so talented. I was just wondering what you guys' thoughts on Kansas were. It's funny, I actually just started going through Kansas's discography today. And I really like them (at least their 70's stuff). But I have a couple of ideas for why they're not that popular here (or in most other prog forums).

One, Kansas is a 70's American prog band, which they're aren't very many of. The only other popular American prog artist is Frank Zappa, whose style is very different from Kansas (Kansas is symphonic prog, while Frank Zappa is RIO/Avant-Prog). So they have a strong American influence in their music, which isn't present in just about any other prog band from the same era, and I imagine this turns some people off.

The first song I remember hearing and knowing it was Camel was Rhayader. 

I remember hearing the intro to All Good People and, based on Owner of a Lonely Heart, I always thought it would get heavy instead of the acoustic mastery of Steve's guitar. All I knew was ""hey this is cool but idk I'm only 10"", and I just left it at that...

Until a few years ago, when I raided my dad's CD collection. He had lots of ELP and Camel especially, plus some Uriah Heep and maybe even some King Crimson. I ripped as many of those as I could to my computer, and after a few days I told my dad what I did (I put them back and everything, of course he was cool about it) and asked him if he had any Yes CDs, and sadly he didn't. So I eventually found a few and went from there. This past April for his birthday though I bought him Fragile and Close to the Edge.

I soon after devoured as much prog as I could get my hands on, and haven't looked back. It was easily the most profound moment in my musical education.  My intro-to-prog-rock story is included in a few paragraphs of my reply to the other thread that is currently trending in this sub.  Apologies to you who have already read that, I will do a little copy-paste here.

I was a weird kid. My parents were no great fans of classical music, but they bought some classical music albums, probably with the idea of introducing me to ""culture."" They didn't discourage me from listening to pop music. But I did in fact develop a strong appreciation of orchestral music, and I always found pop pretty boring.

Now, I didn't like ALL classical music. Mozart and Haydn didn't do that much for me. Beethoven was a bit more to my liking. For some reason, I didn't get to hear much Bach until college. I also didn't care much for opera, though my appreciation grew as I got older.

What I really liked were 19th Century Russian composers. Mussorgsky's ""Night on Bald Mountain"", and Borodin's ""Polovtsian Dances"" and ""Steppes of Central Asia"" were early favorites. By age 10, I had figured out that I also liked late French composers -- Saent-Saens, Faure, Debussy, Ravel. I found related composers from other countries: Grieg, Sibelius, Stravinsky, some Wagner. The best orchestral music, to my ears, was written between about 1870 and 1920, by the Late Romantics and the Impressionists.
 
When I was 13, a slightly older friend of mine introduced me to Genesis: specifically, Wind and Wuthering. For the first time, I was listening to rock music with the epic sweep and harmonic sophistication of the classical music that I loved. And for the first time, I also got some ""grit"" in my music too! King Crimson quickly cured me of my lack of interest in the electric guitar.
 
I started exploring prog. I got to know all of the Big Six, and became a proper fan of four of these bands. In the decades since, I have gotten to know and appreciate many wonderful and ambitious pieces of music in the prog universe. Sometimes, I know just one or two pieces by a band, and I feel like I should explore further. Too much music, too little time.

I eventually found other genres of music as well, but classical and prog were the first two keys to my musical heart.

Ultimately, I took a minor in Music in college.

It's hard to define an ""epic"" really. I think and epic is something with more of a story (2112 and Cygnus are great examples of what I would call an epic). I'm not sure I would toss Mike Oldfield, Yes (except Gates and maybe Tales), or instrumental music in with the bunch. One exception to instrumental would be if the music was very powerful or somehow conveyed a message (I love Mike Oldfield, but his music isn't Powerful, it's mood music). Hergest Ridge, And Tubular Bells are both what I would consider epics. Hergest Ridge was written with Hergest Ridge (the place) in mind, based around the wonders of life and all the rabble. I would say an epic should be more than 15 minutes, any less than that is just a lengthy track (relative to the rest of the music world).

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the splitting tracks thing. I like to be aware that ""holy shit, I'm listening to this hour long song"" and not ""oh hey a compilation album"". I generally listen to a song from beginning to end, the only exception is ""The White Ladies"" by Trace, because Parthetique is one sexy song. If it weren't for Last.fm I wouldn't care either way, though.

Epics are definitely more engaging than short tracks. Just like in a long book you grow more attached to the characters, in an epic you become more embedded in the musical journey. 

Progressive Metal is my avoid at all costs Genre, I can't bother myself to even listen to 5 minute songs from that Genre. Of all the Prog SG's, I'd have to say Progressive Metal is (or has become, maybe) the most bland and it just all sounds the same.

[Seraph - DPR IAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LZe0s5qH3Y&amp;ab_channel=DPRIAN-Topic) 

[Ballrooom Extravaganza - DPR IAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brxkoLjrsFc&amp;ab_channel=DPRIAN-Topic) (less orchestra/jazz in this one, but lyrics sound very fitting imo, but it may not work for the arrangement idk)

[So Beautiful - DPR IAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QQzDQceGgU&amp;ab_channel=DreamPerfectRegime)

&amp;#x200B;

Other songs:

&amp;#x200B;

[Saturn - Sleeping at Last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzNvk80XY9s&amp;ab_channel=SleepingAtLast) half this song is instrumental, beautiful but bittersweet orchestra. Second half is lyrics, about someone's time on earth.  Sleeping at last has a lot of songs similar to this (ie bittersweet about life, beautiful instrumental)

&amp;#x200B;

For full instrumental:

I really like the [La Belle Epoque album by Audiomachine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6FYFLdWdiY&amp;list=PLtjNioz9_qnx7piTc7EwbSw8IrWOt3jil&amp;index=1&amp;ab_channel=Audiomachine).

[Ryan Adams - When the stars go Blue](https://youtu.be/rT0cndgd1kM)

This is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Actually, I'm a depressed single guy with social anxiety. I have no friends whatsoever.

 So, late at night, I just like to lay in bed with my eyes closed, thinking about happy scenarios that'll most likely never happen. Like I'm in a sitcom like friends. In NYC during the snow. With my soulmate. Happy. 

Get it, right?

I wanna hear more songs like this. That'll make me feel this fake nostalgia about stuff that never was and never will be.

Any suggestions/recommendations? I have a playlist that might fit that vibe. It made up of themes of love, loss, reflection &amp; hope.

I'm looking for energetic and joyful songs about going out, having fun, and being young. Not about romance but I'm fine with it being mentioned. I know a lot of female singers have songs like that but I'd also love some male ones. Live Like We're Young by 1D and Friends by Jesse McCartney are some examples.

Of course, those are all radio-friendly pop songs and not particularly good ones. However, I love pop so I don't mind, but if you can also recommend some great indie pop, that would also be much appreciated. I say pop because I don't think any other genre can capture this theme as much as pop can, but you know, feel free to surprise me.

Also, your recommendations do not have to mention being young, it just has to feel youthful. Another Night on Mars by The Maine is a pretty good example.

Final note, while these songs are great, I do not wish for melancholic songs like All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem or Kids by The Midnight or When We Were Young by Picture This. They're very nostalgic and ""God, remember how much fun we used to have"" where Taylor Swift songs like 22 and New Romantics are clearly about CURRENTLY being young and having fun.

[Feryquitous](https://youtube.com/channel/UCDiBALj7YXdOfjPUSdbl6tw) might cover that unnerving ambient vibe well, especially their older stuff - though some songs might have vocals.

[Dstorv - Endorfin rmx](https://youtu.be/vkZxm1Jwqs4) is one of my favs, and the vocals are (mostly) not in any particular real language, they just sound cool. but there's an instrumental if needed. might be a thought for an encounter song... ? the Sincuvate single in general, maybe - it has instrumentals too.

other artists coming to mind for future recs are songs on Deemo soundtracks, Elliot Hsu (though more jrpg style), callasoiled for all kinds of ambient (but somewhat electronic) music... Sakuzyo, or Onoken, maybe.

there's a lot of artists out there for background music, these are just the ones i know offhand. it's always a matter of finding where to start... then getting youtube channels that specialize in uploading similar styles.

Examples of some artists I really dig already: Gunship, The Midnight, Kavinsky, Scandroid, and NERO (although they're more EDM, it fits pretty well).  Recently, I also found Sunset Neon and LeBrock.

And yeah, some artists have a one-off song with a guest vocalist (like Carpenter Brut Anarchy Road [don't get me wrong, I love Carpenter Brut]) but I guess I'm asking for some suggestions of artists that more consistently use vocals.

Any genre really. Earlier this year I got hooked on Lil Nas X after hearing about the movie Call Me By Your Name, which I imagine Montero is related to.

Anyway, it got me thinking. Outside of like... Todd rick Hall and probably one or two I might be missing because they have like one related song, are all I know of (at least actively.)

That being said, we're going to do a bit of 180. I'm open to any genre, but my normal genres steer towards rock. If you need an example of my music, here's the concerts I've been to this year: Imagine Dragons + grandson, Incubus, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blue October.

So run with this concept as you will. I just need more queer music in my life, as a gay man, that isn't just club music.

To reiterate: I'm looking for songs that are queer focused, not just the artist being queer.  Doesn't have to be related to romance, especially considering my normal metal/rock/alt genre. I'm a pretty well rounded music lover though.

Edit: As this post grows, I'm just making a playlist. I'll comment back appreciation when I can. I'll probably just share the playlist too. :3  


Edit2: I can't keep up lol. I've made the [Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/77d1U5PLWCtNZmZye0zNJ3?si=dba49bba22bd40a6) ; It's almost 9 hours so far... How it got there? I've added every individual song suggestion, and for artist suggestions without specific songs I've just added the top five on spotify of each. Feel free to tag or reply if you think I might have missed a song from an artist by being non-specific on songs, or if I should add more of an artist who I've added only one song. I'll continue to add songs, and post some replies when I get to them! Way more than expected. Thanks guys! Todrick Hall is more sassy pop. His first album is actually one long music video on youtube: [Straight Outta Oz](https://youtu.be/4mUSwHhJ6zA) (1HR+) or [Playlist form](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdwYTvwa4xOpDU2UTYH5PKXqrAL9g2EjJ). If you're gay, it's a great and subtle story done through music. I love it. About him being ""dorothy"" and following the red brick road to stardom. He flexes into a lot of stylistic genres but I'd say pop is a pretty common thread. Now that he's popular his newer music has gotten... More comfortable, and ratchet. lol Not in a bad way IMO. But he's just a perfect example of what I think of when I think ""gay"" music. My favorites being in the middle of the first album [Low](https://youtu.be/oexhZ7FKLdU) and [Wrong Bitch](https://youtu.be/Us59fuIVgAk) . Again, the first songs on the album are really different to where the end of the album goes. One of the first favorite songs of mine, [Color](https://youtu.be/8WBAinat0pA)

A lot of the earlier songs aren't as pop, but it escalates pretty quick as the ""movie"" go on.  Worth a casual second monitor watch if you can tolerate the music. It definitely can get very 'loud gay club' energy.

Edit, Edit, Edit: I've edited this like 3 times. Apparently I just love this whole fucking album. He's a great performer, which makes the music videos add SOOOOO much because the music is often a direct relation to the scene, not conceptual.

I need some upbeat music for walking in a busy city in daytime. Something for when you're on the move at a brisk pace.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, but I didn't know where else to ask this.

Thanks.

Edit: If anyone else has any other songs, I'd love to know what they are! What a dope request haha. I love music like this! I've lived in a few big cities including DC and always listen to music when walking. Let's see what I got just going alphabetically. I read you prefer instrumentals so I'll try to keep that in mind, but a good number of these will probably end up having some lyrics.

**A$AP Rocky - Goldie.** I listened to this every morning uni freshman year when I would walk to 8am classes. I went to a big college and there were always a lot of people, even that early. For some reason this song just gets me to 100. 

**Annie - Chewing Gum (Vocal Mix)** is absolutely perfect for this vibe imo. 

**Björk - Army of Me** maybe? Or **Big Time Sensuality**. For both songs you kind of get lost in the beat/Björk's vocals along with the crowd. 

**BROCKHAMPTON - BOOGIE** might be too aggressive but keeps you moving for sure. 

**chelmico - Player** just really energetic pop rap (in Japanese if you're okay w that). 

**Crystal Castles - Baptism** is an instrumental bopper that I listen to a lot when walking around

**DAOKO - ShibuyaK** was literally made for walking around Shibuya (home to the world's busiest pedestrian crossing). Pop Japanese rap, but different energy from chelmico

**Grimes - Venus Fly** could go with a number of Grimes songs, but this is probably the best one for what you're talking about

**Utada Hikaru - Automatic**. Her best R&amp;B song, one of the best R&amp;B songs in general imo

**Iglooghost - Bug Thief** maybe??? It's a great instrumental, not sure if I associate it with walking in a crowded city but... maybe!

**Kelly Lee Owens - Melt!** more of an end-of-day duskish instrumental bop, not quite nighttime and things are winding down but you still have somewhere to go, something to do. Kind of a specific mood

**Kero Kero Bonito - Trampoline** I like playing this when I'm walking and it's raining for some reason. I dunno why

**Persona 5 Soundtrack - Tokyo Daylight**. Literally video game music for walking around Tokyo... but jazz funk disco-ly

**Machine Girl - Krystle - URL Cyber Palace Mix**. You'll either hate it or feel goddamn invincible listening to it

**Macross 82-99 - Horsey** just good future city funk for jamming. Good for a sunny day

**Nujabes - luv (sic.) pt 3 \[ft.shing02\]** You can listen to this motherfucking song anywhere. Another one where you kind of lose yourself in the crowd/music and let your body move you to where you need to be. Also it is ""literally"" about.. walking lol

I have no idea where to begin. I will keep a long story as brief as I can, for the sake of everyone.

My entire life, I have never held any interest for music at all. I avoided films with overwhelming soundtracks. I turned off the music if playing a video game. I drive in silence. The simple fact that I listen to nothing has unnerved people throughout my life. So many people define themselves my the music they listen too, and I've always known that there is something cultural that I've been severely missing out on. Music has always just been unnecessary noise to me with no redeeming qualities.

Strangely enough, the only time that I've found myself enjoying a tune is while drinking. I couldn't tell you what any of the music was, though-- I don't know any names of songs or bands. I've found that music sounds 'unscrambled' when my brain is altered with alcohol, and I can sort decode the sounds that are coming to me. I'm having trouble explaining it.

At 25, though, it finally... clicked. Growing up, I was forbidden from watching TV and movies, playing games, or listening to music for six days of the week. This probably had some kind of psychological effect on me, but it's also more than that. I was recently diagnosed with severe ADHD as an adult and learned that it doesn't need to involve hyperactivity, but can just be a lack of mental focus. The medication has had a gradual effect on my behavior and ways of thinking until, suddenly, I listened to something a friend was playing. And it was... really good.

Now I want to listen to everything and I have no idea where to begin. I don't know songs, bands, genres, instruments, nothing. Are there songs that are almost universally loved that I can use as jumping-off points?

Truth is, coincidentally, I have a blind date coming up too, and I'm absolutely done with being embarrassed to say my favorite music isn't any music at all. I need to find something that I love to talk about. 

Thank you very much for everyone who reads this.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I disliked music up until recently, and I do not know where to begin. I have no background knowledge of any songs, bands, albums, genres, or instruments. Are there any basic recommendations anyone has for must-listen music that you would expect anyone to know? I don't personally listen to any ""essential"" music, because I don't think there is anything essential to music taste. Everyone's different, so what I will do is link a variety of different tracks just so you can explore. I am hoping to really capture stuff that might not be mentioned in the other comments, and each one will be quite different. If you want any information on any of them, let me know, as I would consider myself knowledgeable on the genres I've linked below. From there we can see what else you might like.

[Big L - Put It On.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWMjRMJ0dTI) Classic 90s hip-hop. You'll find the beat is a different tempo and style to modern rap, which will typically have a ""trap beat"". Lyrically, there is a lot of intricate, multi-syllabic rhyming. The subject matter in hip-hop tracks is typically about money, drugs, crime, women, and in this case for the most, rap-skill. Big L was also a contributor to a sub-genre of hip-hop known as ""horrorcore"" which would indulge in the more violent aspects of rap, usually to a ridiculous, fictitious extent.

[BLACKPINK - As If It's Your Last.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amq-qlqbjYA) 3rd generation K-pop. Catchy as f\*ck. Embraces aspects of bubblegum pop that the Western industry does not, resulting is something much more upbeat and chirpy than American pop. K-pop often goes beyond the music, where fans enjoy exploring (and sometimes obsessing over) the personalities of each member, the outfits used in each M/V, etc. 

[Genetix - Squid Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyP20Wa0gDY) Dubstep. A sub-genre of EDM, dubstep has super slow drums and huge emphasis on bass. There's huge variation, but the track linked in a classic, using a lot of ""wobble,"" but there are also growls, plucks, and all other odd noises that Dubstep prides itself on. This particular tune was released near the beginning of the ""American wave"" of dubstep, but still stays *very* true to its roots. Prior to this, the sounds were slowly, grimier, and has less mid-range action, but I imagine you don't want a history lesson.

[Igorrr - Tendon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWca1X7nFGo) Igorrr is like no other. Elements of classical, black metal, breakcore, and more. I'll say no more, this is simply a unique experience.

Kind of like electronic chill music, but a bit more specific than that. Like, beautiful but melancholy.

A few songs to give an example:

-        Edge Hill by Groove Armada (https://youtu.be/tkt4uwb_T2o)
-        Passing By by Zero7 (https://youtu.be/oZ6q_-VS07U)
-        Hayling by FC Kahuna (https://youtu.be/BUIzq-HcNPA)
-        Miles to Go by Kaskade (https://youtu.be/ef-v9MvG2kQ)


I can’t really tell what the common thread is - Edge Hill is probably my favorite and that’s all instrumental. But I love the vocal style of Hayling and Miles to Go (chorus). And Passing By just has that melancholy ambience. Always makes me think of a rainy day in the city.

Thanks for any suggestions! I would say the first 3 fall under lofi hip hop/chillhop and you can find loads of it on the internet. Heres an example:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8CWYoIOftTo

Youll find a lot of samples and similar sounds between artists. Can be hit or miss but ive found that once you find a particular artist you enjoy, theyre fairly consistent in quality.

The last one seems to be some sort of electronic (honestly not super great at determining electronic subgenres because there are many). You might like these?

Hi all,
I've been on a huge binge of comforting music in recent memory, particularly in the realm of ambient / drone.

Can anyone suggest music in a similar vein to Stars of the Lid and their solo projects (Brian Mcbride's solo work, The Dead Texan etc), Christina Vantzou, Gallery Six, Grouper, Julianna Barwick, Willamette etc?

If they don't mention a time of night that's okay but bonus points if they mention 12am/1am/3am :) thank you sm you're all lifesavers.

My idea is to touch on the idea of the 'witching hour', comparing how some songs romanticise this time of night while some are more traditional and appease the classic 'spooky' and 'creepy' vibez Most of these make general mentions to it being night, the only one that mentions a specific time is Welcome to the show by VOSTOK.

Dusty Trails- Lucius

Vienna- Billy Joel

Unconditionally- Katy Perry

Chiquitita- ABBA

I'm after a vibe that's sensual, but isn't innocent or whimsical; something that has a ""bad"" quality to it. It would likely be something with female vocals. The song should have a this feeling of an ""ultimate coming together"", when you finally get together with someone and desire them, but it's not really a sweet or innocent desire. With that said, I will consider the more sweet or innocent kind; the type of vibe where you've wanted someone for a long time and finally have them.

Here's some examples:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQiF1yOnzDg](https://sys.4channel.org/derefer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuQiF1yOnzDg) (Dhruv - double take)

This song has the right sensuality, and isn't as innocent, but I find that it's a little bit too lively or high energy. The synth bassline is too distracting for my liking and draws your attention too much.

For bands I recommend Ohphelia (great harmonies) and Good Times Family Band (great lyrics). A bit more on the folk side. 

If you want to try something a little different I recommend this chill instrumental electronic album, it’s my go-to for when I’m feeling anxious and I don’t think it would trigger your headaches, it’s very calm.

Edit: this was a fantastic idea. All of you have great and varied recommendations, and I will listen to them all. Ok since so many people gave me so many great recommendations, I figured it was only fair to give back. Here are a few lesser known songs and artists that are great:

- Please take me home / Luther

Such an uplifting and powerful song, that was on a really weird yet interesting album, full of all sorts of genres and styles. If you like this one, check out the full album called “the Ages”.

- Moby Dick / Jakey

While Nakeyjakey is actually a fairly popular YouTuber, he’s also an incredibly underrated musician, and quite possibly my all time favourite. All his songs are amazing, and so very unique. His entire discography amounts to only 7 songs, so if you like this one, just listen to them all.

- Panacea / Disasterpiece

This is from the OST of an incredible indie game called Hyper Light Drifter, however I heard it first before playing the game, and it was so good that it inspired me to play the game. This is a stripped down piano melody that gives me chills everytime. It’s one of the most beautiful pieces I’ve ever heard, but pretty much the only people who would know about it are those who have played the game till the end credits. Well worth a listen.

- Future Kids of America / Derek Pope

Pope has some pretty enjoyable yet unremarkable EDM/hiphop style beats, and a nice voice, but there’s something about the progression of his melodies that gets me. Future Kids of America is definitely his most unique and interesting song, so it also doubles as his best song, too.

Hey y'all. I've recently been looking for more stuff that is fantasy themed (Diggy Diggy Hole, Soldiers of the Wasteland by Dragonforce, Miracle of Sound, Alestorm, Brothers of Metal, Sabaton kinda, etc.) stuff that goes hard and you can feel it in your chest. Now, I don't want screamo, if there are lyrics I want to be able to hear it clearly and understand what they're singing, and I do kind of want it to have lyrics. I've got plenty of other things for during the session and instrumental stuff, but I don't have enough stuff to listen to and sing along with when I'm doing prep work and thinking about the game world. Anybody got some suggestions for fantasy/adventure/sci-fi inspired songs? I already have a great deal of sea shanties, but never enough D&amp;D themed music type stuff. (and before anyone says bardcore versions of already existing popular songs, I have heard most of them and while I do like them I am more looking for original stuff than covers)

TL:DR;

1, no screamo
2, lyrics please
3, D&amp;D/Fantasy themed
4, some soft stuff is fine, but would rather have something that goes hard.
5, I already know about bardcore, but am looking for new stuff moreso than covers.

Some context on my music taste:

I am very into electronic music, especially liquid drum'n'bass, Kpop (for examples of what I mean, listen to K/DA - More, or 4Minute - Crazy), and even some mixed genre stuff (like Electric Callboys - We Got The Moves). Don't know what genre Pogo is but I really like his stuff too!

I'm also into general pop/rock, like Queen, Coldplay, Toto, Beach Boys, ABBA, Metallica, etc.

Music can be either with or without vocals!

If you have time, take several hours to listen and read. Spread it out over a few days, maybe. But trust me, it's worth it.

Hey /r/popheads! Today is Michael Jackson's birthday. As your tireless MJ crusader I have no plan when I start to write this post, except to bring to attention the works of this man - and to recommend you check out more from his music than what you are used to. Michael Jackson was a true visionary, who changed the definition of the pop star, dramatically influencing the visuals, the fashion, the sound and the enigma of pop music. His videos were groundbreaking, his dance and choreography the stuff of legend, his songwriting and collaborations with producers are brilliant, and his voice is a unique instrument of joy, anger, passion, disdain, confidence and insecurity that has gone unmatched. His music morphed from chart-topping, perfectly crafted pop talking of life, love and desire to highly politically and emotionally charged music dealing with loneliness, injustice, greed, unrequited love and a never-ending passion to set it all right.

More than that, he was a very special man. Known to all his friends and colleagues as an exceedingly humble and generous man, well-read and soft-spoken, he became a true humanitarian, fighting for the underdogs in the world. Stories of his support for young AIDS patients, millions of dollars donated to hundreds of causes are lesser known than his love for children, especially those with troubled lives. Having been a performer from a very young age and increasingly being made to act as a grown up when still a child gave MJ the feeling that he never had a childhood and had missed out on a natural youth. He seemed to have made a vow to live the rest of his life carefree, shameless in his 'childish' love for the simple pleasures in life, and was very eager to spread this idea. Having felt the pain of child abuse and isolation as a child, it was his dream to help children worldwide to experience the exact opposite. This noble dream is the stuff of fairy tales, but so was this guy, a larger-than-life figure who loved climbing trees just as much as he loved gyrating on stage with sexy back-up dancers.

Where adoration comes first, controversy follows soon after. His different nature encouraged the wildest ideas to sprout. His withdrawn unwillingness to shed light on his peculiarities accelerated the speculation. After reaching the absolute height of fame, Michael Jackson became the world's biggest target. As vitiligo destroyed the pigments in the skin of the world's most well known black man, as a touch of vanity went a step too far and changed the shape of his face, as his love for childhood was confused for a stunted maturity, as his artistic efforts were increasingly ignored in favour of sensationalist crucifixion, as the most immoral crimes known to man were attached to his name forever, as authorities investigated him for decades (finding nothing), his legacy morphed from simply one of the greatest entertainers of all time, the ultimate game changer, to a freak, a weirdo, a child molester. Stories were thrown at him to see which ones stuck and the public swallowed it willingly.

Painfully, his death changed much, as suddenly the public realized again what it was he had achieved. All too little, all too late.

Michael Jackson helped me discover who I am. His music, his talent, his life has inspired me in countless ways. I admire his ideas, I admire his visions, and I have learned from his life story the highs and lows of pop culture, the heights and depths one man can reach. In June 2009 I had two tickets to his comeback concerts in London in my pocket, ready to witness what would probably have been the greatest day in my life. But it never came to be. We were robbed of the tour, of the music, of the man. This killed me. I was devastated. I realized then that he was not a pop star to me, but an example, something I could hold on to when in doubt, something to aspire to, and when all that fell away prematurely, in such a tragic fashion, that hurt me more than I usually dare to admit.

So that's why I might seem a one-trick-pony sometimes. :)

58 years ago today, Michael Jackson was born as the youngest son in a large family living in arguably one of the most dangerous cities in the United States: Gary, Indiana. To keep their sons off the streets, Katherine and Joseph Jackson encouraged their sons to work on their obvious musical talents. 

What began with performing at local night clubs, continued into a Motown contract and instant success as The Jackson 5's first 4 singles all hit #1 on the charts, continued in the group leaving Motown and becoming known as The Jacksons, with the obvious star Michael gaining an increasingly more prominent role as the elusive, mercurial star of the show. 

There are six albums to remember from this time which I recommend you check out on your own time:

- *Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5*
- *ABC*
- *Third Album*
- *Dancing Machine*
- *Destiny*
- *Triumph*

But as The Jackson 5 morphed from the cute harmonies and insanely catchy melodies of the Motown music factory to a more funk-driven and mature group in the Jacksons, with Michael writing his first songs, Michael Jackson grew increasingly ambitious.

The few solo albums he recorded for Motown as a kid are pretty nice. It's a part of his career most people forget, although songs from that time are classics: Ben, One Day In Your Life, Got To Be There. I recommend you check out Music And Me as well.

But the success wasn't enough for Michael Jackson. He was a learner, always observing, always eager to improve, and when legendary producer Quincy Jones worked together with him on the all-black remake of *The Wizard Of Oz* he saw the potential. The two of them teamed up on what would become, until a few years later, the biggest album ever by a black musician:

**Off The Wall**:

*Off The Wall* is disco's last stand at the end of the 70's. It showcases a young, exuberant MJ discovering his range and talent to evoke emotion vocally at the age of 21. This album feels completely alive and liberating.

Check out the songs:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZorRGrDiMsA *Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough* starts off the album and you could end it there and it would still be a classic. Smooth, sensual and yet playful and innocent, this is some statement to start the album off with. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X-Mrc2l1d0 *Rock With You* was written by Rod Temperton and is a perfect example of what this album is all about - a joyful celebration of the night life, of desire expressed in all its subtlety or openness. Check out the harmonies on the chorus!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6P7aQtNpsA *Working Day And Night* is a frantic, funky song, full of impatience and haste, as the singer tries and tries to win a girl over, but all his efforts seem in vain. I especially love how the sound of his voice tells half the story, regardless of the lyrics.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdYwglFL6iM *Get On The Floor* is a perfect example of what Quincy Jones is all about. The whole of the album is a perfect storm of vocals and production, and almost nowhere better than here. Just listen to the instruments!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDUbMBcXoj8 *Off The Wall* is the title track, written by Rod Temperton (yeah that guy again) that summarizes the album, a youthful, vibrant song that just can't wait to burst out and get to dancing. Again, I love the variations on the melody from MJ's voice as the song progresses. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6LUPlmua6I *Girlfriend* was written by Paul McCartney. It's simple, playful and airy, as the singer expresses the wish to make a girl all his own instead of sharing her. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DQJPL9Yuq0 *She's Out Of My Life* is, as Quincy Jones explained it, the grown-up version of *Ben*. As legend has it, MJ would burst into tears as he sang the song, so his tears at the end are genuine. On-stage performances played up the melodrama big time, but in all its purity it's a fabulous ballad.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnhWML43NI8 *I Can't Help It* has the smoothest vocals on the album - soaring, stuttering, breathing in a Stevie Wonder-esque fashion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMt-sI_zRH0 *It's The Falling In Love* is perhaps the most dated song on the album, a duet full of energy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lH_LCHUp6E&amp;gl=BE *Burn This Disco Out* ends off the album - written by Rod Temperton (this guy, what a collection of songs he's written!) - in style. It has it all - the vocals that soar, the lyrics that want to get it all out there, the flawless production.

*Off The Wall* was very succesfull, but not enough. Michael Jackson wanted more. He wanted the recognition of the music world, the mainstream music world, which was dominated by white rock music. So he and Quincy Jones worked together again on what would become the best-selling music album in history, do I need to introduce it?

**Thriller**

Pop, rock and funk fuse to create an album that wants it all, and does it all. *Thriller* is ambition come to life. Every song is crafted to perfection, thought-out and executed brilliantly. The lyrical content shifts from the care-free joys of *Off The Wall* to pulsating texts on paranoia, romance bursting at the seams, nostalgia almost too ambiguous to express. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Uj3zitETs4 *Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'* starts something alright - three drums in and you already know this ain't no disco, but a relentless time bomb of a song that never takes a moment's rest. As so many of songs solely written by Michael (which is a much larger amount than people think!) the lyrics express only half of the meaning (people who want to mess with other people's lives), and the vocal expression does the rest.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG9OzYVSg3c *Baby Be Mine* is energetic and sexy. Listen to his voice squeal and groan and slide effortlessly over these verses! And of course a song as good as this was written by Rod Temperton!


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHp0s2wKajw *The Girl Is Mine* features two of the greastest artists in history, but sparks don't exactly fly: the song is tongue-in-cheek, lofty, adorable, plays it safe and does it well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA&amp;gl=BE + album version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAVX-MlBfew *Thriller* is the first in the album's 'Holy Trinity' and it is campy, is wild, is different, is everything the album wants to be. Horror imagery to what is ultimately a love song, with sharp vocals, iconic instrumentals, and one of the greatest music videos you'll ever see. I am in love with this song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=Ym0hZG-zNOk *Beat It* was written by MJ in a wish to cross over, and cross over he did, with this timeless song about not giving in to the machoism and peer pressure of being a 'tough guy'. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y&amp;gl=BE *Billie Jean* is the first song in a series of songs where Michael Jackson no longer simply croons over a woman, but laments her treatment of him. Love is dangerous in the MJ universe and it creates haunting expressions of paranoia and second-guessing, such as in this perfection of pop. Written by MJ, another song in his universe where there is always a reason to distrust others.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J1csvknF00 *Human Nature* is atmospheric, nocturnal, melancholic, happy and yet sad. It paints a picture of a city at night, of a wish to be free, of the unwillingness to compromise identity. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYXqwbtkkeM *P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)* - but don't sit down yet! The album has one last uptempo banger to offer, and wow it is a treat. The energy and passion is off the charts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc_KSe6FUoU *The Lady In My Life* ends off the album with the most mature and sincere expression of romance (oh and did I mention the great Rod Temperton wrote this)

Thriller could have been enough. But for Michael Jackson, it was not. He had been there, and had done that. It was time for something different.

**Bad** 

*Bad* commercially did not reach the heights of its predecessor, but let's be fair here, nothing ever will. What *Bad* does, however, is radically change the MJ game. Before this, there was a smooth and haunted pop star, but now we have a synth-driven bad boy, in black leather, eager to redefine himself as a sharp-edged artist. The last collaboration between Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones, with MJ writing most of the songs (9 of the 11)


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHdDtuzreVQ + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Svpzy--K8Q (long video, in two parts) *Bad* makes it very clear. This is a different album and a different Michael, who grunts, whispers and growls his way through a classic statement of intent. Check out the choreography in the video!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzZ_urpj4As *The Way You Make Me Feel* picks up steam right off the bat - an exuberant call for love with drums like a steam train.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWl3jyQiz3Q *Speed Demon* is funk rock about wanting to experience the thrill of the chase but ultimately being stopped from it. The slight hint of a more political meaning to the song has been suggested very often, where a police officer condescendingly calls MJ 'boy' as he gives him a ticket.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3V-7DEAgdc *Liberian Girl* doesn't leave a doubt about its 'racial' content, as MJ describes his love for an African woman in *Bad*'s most simple and carefree track.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isaSLsH8l0c *Just Good Friends* is an energetic duet between two greats, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vwHQNQ88cM *Another Part Of Me* is a vibrant song wishing for unity and connectedness in an almost prophetic fashion. Typical MJ: when under a microscope, some of the lyrics are nonsense, but in the bigger picture, vocals, music and words, it all makes sense.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_D3VFfhvs4 *Smooth Criminal* is exhilarating, haunting, calculated and gorgeous - and the visuals that come with the song are legendary.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crbFmpezO4A *Leave Me Alone* is one of the many Jackson songs with double meanings - is he asking the girl in the song to leave him alone, or the world? What's greater here, the harmonies or the beat?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PivWY9wn5ps *Man In the Mirror* is a masterpiece - touching, heartfelt, filled with soul and dedication.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPmo7owRU6o *Dirty Diana* is MJ goes glamrock and he does it damn well in this cautionary tale about groupies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZ1Bii7Uwk *I Just Can't Stop Loving You* is a rare duet in the MJ discography, but even then it's still clearly the best one.

So, that's *Bad*. But the 90's are coming. It's time for something new, thinks MJ, so he goes out to reinvent himself - new lyrical content, new sound, new visuals, new producers, new atmosphere. The result is the powerful *Dangerous*.

**Dangerous**

An album with two faces: a heavily produced, urban, new jack swing and hip hop inspired beginning, and an MJ-brand 'epic pop' second half swinging from anger to passion to sadness in the blink of an eye. ""An album that can alternately be paranoid, cryptic, sensual, vulnerable, idealistic, bleak, transcendent, and fearful.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=JbHI1yI1Ndk *Jam* is a heart-stopping exercise in new jack swing with lyrics typical for the album, marveling at the modern world and its tendency to mess with your head, and MJ's resolve to not give in and keep his composure.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qSfCjVk6Xc *Why You Wanna Trip On Me* is busy and dramatic. Why would you focus on the exploits of a pop star if there is so much ACTUALLY bad going on in the world?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qLY0vbrT8Q *In The Closet* is MJ's raciest track, a steamy song about keeping an affair behind closed doors even when it seems to be exploding from desire at every second. Check out Naomi Campbell in the video!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlBZbog78p8 *She Drives Me Wild* is a song built around a metaphor - cars everywhere here, as this new jack swing adventure proclaims a girl to be something special, and MJ wants in on that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeiFF0gvqcc *Remember The Time* - note it's all black cast in the video, which is no exception for MJ's career is smooth as shit and has the clearest vocals on the album, is according to many dedicated to Diana Ross, the woman he fell in love with as a young star in Motown.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MBhxAO-T1I *Can't Let Her Get Away* ends off the new jack swing section and does it well - roaring verses, pounding beat, smooth chorus. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWf-eARnf6U *Heal The World* is sugary and cheesy, but don't for a second doubt its sincerity and intent. Amidst the wild emotion, both confident and insecure, is a pop star who wants to see the world become a better place.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IH0N469RF8 *Black Or White* is a song closer to MJ's heart than you'd think. It really shouldn't matter, he sings, in life and love, what colour you are. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgGVvUhMJ5Q *Who Is It* is the perfect hybrid between Teddy Riley's new jack swing and Jackson's epic pop, a long, droning and paranoid song about suspicion and doubt. These lyrics are pretty dark and haunting. Epic bass line. One of his greatest songs ever.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ7qXHjxj_0 *Give In To Me* is my favourite MJ song. Dramatic and passionate, fiery and demanding, guitar solos all over the place. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1nK3TMcL7A *Will You Be There* seems sugary and sweet at first, but man if it isn't another song where MJ just seems like the loneliest man. One of the many long songs that start off as ballads and end off with epic choirs chanting as MJ screams for recognition and support.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6NJ-5MuPmw *Keep The Faith* has Michael Jackson going gospel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNamirwTaY&amp;gl=BE *Gone Too Soon* is a short and sweet ballad inspired by a young boy with AIDS who MJ befriended, and lost, before recording the album. And now, it could be about him as well. ""Born to inspire, to amuse, to delight - here one day, gone one night.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-DyQ268AFs *Dangerous* is funky, industrial, dense, whispery - the woman is no good but he's kinda into it.


MJ didn't have the best of times after this album. Accusations, drug abuse, failed ventures, endless vilification in the press. This led to what is at once the most exemplary album of what Michael Jackson really was, and at the same time the least Michael Jackson-like album out there: 

**HIStory: Past, Present And Future, Book I** (there is no Book II)

This album is something else. Epic orchestration, a ridiculously broad range of subjects, a defiant fist and at the same time a hopeless flailing hand - a statement of despair and rebellion, a wish to be understood and a desire to be different. The music here is Disney-like at one turn, and almost devoid of rhythm the next. The vocals go from saccharine sighs to incomprehensible grunting. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P4A1K4lXDo *Scream* with Janet Jackson starts off the album, which tells a story from start to finish. MJ and Janet roar at the world for its slander and lies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1pqi8vjTLY *They Don't Care About Us* is an anthem about systemic racism and injustice in the United States. MJ is disenchanted at how minorities are treated. The song is also about himself, as he was not too long ago also hounded by the authorities who subjected him to harsh treatment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEEMi2j6lYE *Stranger In Moscow* is a haunting melancholic pearl of a song about the loneliness of fame and how it can drive a man insane.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZchFrLogMqA *This Time Around* wants you to know that MJ is done giving up and bending the knee. It's defiant, it's angry, and it's barely a pop song, but the emotion is real and genuine. The Notorious B.I.G. is on this!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=XAi3VTSdTxU *Earth Song* - and in the blink of an eye, anger at his personal life becomes sadness over the entire planet, as this haunting epic describes the environmental destruction of earth and the despair of its inhabitants to put a stop to it. ""I used to dream, I used to glance beyond the stars. Now I don't know where we are, although I know we've drifted far.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=026_wXsJFWc *D.S.* and then we go back to his personal life again. D.S. is a petty, vindictive song, an uneasy listen, and very real - in this song MJ lashes out at Tom Sneddon, the man responsible for the witch hunt he had to face in 1993.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stM8TJK-Zi0 *Money* is a hypnotic semi-spoken word song about greed and those who do anything for money, even betray those close to them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubR9cXWkXv8 *Come Together* is an odd choice at this point of the album and at this point in time, as it was recorded for his movie Moonwalker right when *Bad* came out. But here it is, this steamy cover of the Beatles' classic (and cryptical) song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtmbZbzr680 *You Are Not Alone* is smooth rnb, a very obvious number 1 candidate - but does it sound convincing to you? In an album so desperate, it should be noted that the protagonist of the song is singing this to himself. He is comforting himself, not his lover. It's MJ who needs love.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puQEcN_iI9o *Childhood* - if there was ever a song ready to be put inside a Disney movie. A sugary sweet, melancholic ballad that is extremely important to understand the man who sang it. In an effort to reclaim a lost childhood, he admits, he has become a different person, but please do take a second and try to understand him.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8kUYr2ZC6U *Tabloid Junkie* is the apex of the album. Epic, flawless production. Lyrics about sensationalism and hypocrisy. Vocals so filled with anger you can barely understand them.


http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2qhlcr *2 Bad* for some reason has Shaquille O'Neal rapping on it, but regardless, it's like *This Time Around*'s twin: electronic, hectic, defiant.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=BoOFVh5bNb0 *HIStory* is the ambitious title track, comparing personal struggle to historical triumph.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjGO-u-Z6kU *Little Susie* is a testament to Michael Jackson's heart. On an album of anger at the world he finds place for an unsettling and uncomfortable song about a young child who suffers neglect and dies, alone and forgotten. There is no redemption here, nothing to soothe the pain, no happy ending. If you want a happy ending, you...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiKJmBgAfFE&amp;gl=BE *Smile* - you just have to smile. The album starts with a scream, but ends with a smile. Even in tough times, try to stay happy. Try to look for that ray of sunlight. A strong and meaningful way to end this special collection of songs.

Not that much later, MJ would return to his roots. But, to add some meat to a collection of remixed songs, MJ dug even deeper.


**Blood On The Dance Floor: HIStory In The Mix**

5 new songs feature on the best-selling remix album of all time, and they dig to the very depths of Michael Jackson's mindset at the time. Industrial, funky, scary, heartfelt.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3_NntYhzV4&amp;gl=BE *Blood On The Dance Floor* is a dance track with whispers about a dangerous woman who is out to ruin your life - where did we hear this before? In the broader sense, this song seems to be about the danger of STD's while pursuing casual sex, but that's just fan's 'canon'.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn-n_Y-ISkY *Morphine* is a pounding, soul-crushing thing. MJ, who notoriously suffered from drug addiction at various points in his life, writes a terrifying track about a drug addict, an enabler and the drug itself, engaging in some sort of 'dialogue' where everyone gets a word in, in a spiral of self-hate and justification. And then the bridge hits, as MJ sings about the powerful sedative Demerol and the feeling of bliss it gives you in the midst of relentless hammering and pain. Yes - Michael Jackson sang a song that allows for such a description. You cannot casually listen to something so painful and prophetic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r59yAGGDXT0 *Superfly Sister* is a bit cryptical - is it about his sister whose husband was no good? Is it about the hypersexualization of society, losing its traditional values? Is it about preaching modesty? In any case, it's funky, and weird, and different.


http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2q1ui0 *Ghosts* is a typical song where scary imagery serves as a metaphor to lash out at jealous types who are out to hurt him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSNPveb8i-Y *Is It Scary* is the sequel to *Ghosts*. Very similar lyrical content - but wow, those lyrics. The realness. MJ turns the mirror on himself and the audience. If they truly want him to be a freak, he'll be a freak. But only if they realize that by painting him as a monster, they are monsters themselves. The ""truth and purity"" is ""inside a lonely heart"".

Check out his movie *Ghosts* (40 mins) about a prejudiced mayor who wants the 'town freak' to leave. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW9JYCK0GxI

So, yeah. That man was angry. Seems like the anger was gone, for the most part, and Michael was eager to return to his roots as an r&amp;b and soul singer. That effort, although maimed by a seriously deteriorating relationship with his record label, became:

**Invincible**

*Invincible* is the perfect mix between early and late MJ: smooth and careless ballads, lonely expressions of doubt, defiant screams for rebellion, and a hand that reaches out to the problems in the world. The ballad-heavy tracklist tells a story, amidst the songs with other subjects: wanting to get a girl, having the girl, losing the girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiWyeblpr4s *Unbreakable* (which BEGS for a video) starts off the early album's strange infatuation with the word 'break' with the declaration that you can't just keep this man down - he'll rise up and rise again.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWjYxR2cs5s *Heartbreaker* is Timberlake-esque R&amp;B with some minor dubstep influences about, you guessed it, a dangerous woman, and MJ who fell into her trap! 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miBfwWHSmb8 *Invincible* is the title track, a smooth and tasty R&amp;B song about a girl who is playing hard to get.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gkRz7_eVk *Break Of Dawn* is as R&amp;B as MJ is ever gonna get. Smooth and seductive song about a passionate relationship.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON7vBGrjpz8 *Heaven Can Wait* sounds like a song that can't wait to get its message out. MJ's love is impatient and eager to be expressed. The song is said to be about his daughter Paris.
""If the angels took me from this earth

I would tell them bring me back to her

It’s a chance I’ll take, maybe I’ll stay

Heaven can wait""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-7ABIM2qjU *You Rock My World* is the poppiest of pop on the record, and this far into the album it should be clear this is no 90's Michael. This is the updated version of his younger self, looking for new sounds and styles while covering old terrain thematically.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthgd_Rg1qg *Butterflies* is a romantic ballad fit for the turn of the milennium and has - as the fans agree - the best falsetto part in his career.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwT9fJ2HKHg *Speechless* is sweet, sugary and magical, and pure Michael Jackson in its bashful and yet exuberant nature.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHd1rLurxNk *2000 Watts* features uncharacteristically low vocals from Jackson on a steamy track ready to hit the dance floor, using musical equipment as a metaphor for sex.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMcBmZw5Kh8 *You Are My Life* - ""Love is the answer to all that I am"". This song is MJ declaring his love for his children, whose presence seems to have healed a lot of the hurts in his life.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtk5CWOU464 *Privacy* is a gritty and harsh-sounding song asking the paparazzi to stay away from him, wondering if even the death of Princess Diana (alledgedly being caused by a high speed chase between a driver and a photographer) is not enough to stop them.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdsb6zByWfY *Don't Walk Away* introduces another round of ballads (I love this album but the ballads, I can't hold all these ballads!!) with a sad and forlorn wish to not abandon a relationship, although it seems to have failed already.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=mj3MfUR35CM *Cry* with its somewhat cryptical lyrics expresses an overall concern for the pains of the world and a desire to help get rid of them, together. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxNZJjvl2wc *The Lost Children* is a lullaby-esque song, that is strangely haunting, and so typically MJ, where he sings his worries about children who have gone missing. His son Prince declares his love for ""all the lovely flowers"" in the end of the track.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIJXOZZxnlA *Whatever Happens* is here to help end the album on a strong note. Carlos Santana and MJ work together for some latin/pop rock for this hot and bothered song about a relationship falling apart despite efforts from both parties to keep it together. My favourite on the album, perhaps.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcPy6YFUMXo *Threatened* ends the album - it's another New Gothic song where MJ takes the shape of a monster to scare away his opponents. The bassline!


Of course, there is so much more. Posthumous releases will keep coming, some disrespectful, other unethical, and some quite pleasing. But all in all, these songs are the meat of his career and should be heard by anyone who claims to be a pophead, I feel. There is so much more to MJ than the 80's fame, most of all.

I can also very much recommend watching these three concerts if you are ever bored and have some hours to spend watching a master of the stage do his thing:

This is long, my bad. I don't really have any crazy tea to spill, but this is my full experience of my crazy weekend.

Let me begin this by saying I went to a VMA pre-party the night before which featured performances by Bebe Rexha (ngl, I wasn't feeling it), Phantogram (amazing), and Tove Lo (also amazing). I was sponsored and catered by Taco Bell (which is ridiculous) and I ended up throwing up bean burritos at 5AM after a night of binge drinking.

I mention this because I need to set the mood where my hangover and body was cured by all the slayage I had witnessed last night. I've been to the VMAs before - first time was 2009 (Kanye/Taylor moment, Gaga slaying, etc) where I joanne-level scammed Russell Brand into giving me a ticket when I met him (he was hosting) by lying and saying that VMA was my 18th birthday (it wasn't) and the second time was 2013 [(here's a shot of me being thirsty for Zayn)](https://www.instagram.com/p/dd_M6OHGmm/?taken-by=calltehshots), but this is the VMA I really needed to be at - It's Rihanna, Bey, and Britney in one night. I literally couldn't have built a better lineup for me.

So I prop my hungover ass up, try to look decent, and head to Madison Square Garden. I had to be there at 6 and the show didn't start until 9 so I'm sitting in the holding room bored out of my ass, trying to not let this hangover consume me. We get let into the pit section around 8 and I am immediately shook and cured from just seeing the set. I couldn't really take pictures during the show because they warned you that if you get caught holding your phone during performances they'll kick you out and my phone ended up dying anyway, [but here's one little video I took of me being there](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJrAem6APyt/?taken-by=calltehshots). The set is SO small, I saw a couple clips of it on TV and it looked huge and that's a lie lol. Where I was standing was right between the main stage and the part where everyone was getting their awards - I was only a couple feet from everyone which was a lot to process. 

The first ""celebrity"" I see is Farrah Abraham, dressed as Wonder Woman, running around to everyone like a cat in heat and after that all the real famous people started to roll in. 

The show is about to start and I can see Rihanna standing there in her HBA outfit and I already know this is gonna be a night where I am mentally and physically shook. She does her first medley and it's a lot of fun and the whole audience is really feeling it, it was a great start. The reggae portion of her set was probably the best, crowd-wise. It got everyone super hype. The third set was also a blast. Her last set left me speechless vocally. When she was singing Diamonds, I literally felt a wave of goosebumps fall through my body. She killed all the performances, it was great that she performed all through the night to keep the energy in the place alive.

Ariana and Nicki were second and while aesthetically, I was slayed, Side to Side completely killed the audience's vibe after Rihanna. No one knew the song except me and 1 other person next to me and you could feel that no one really cared for it. She should've done Into You, it would've brought the house down. Also, there was a point where Nicki was standing there with her back towards us and I could see every nook and cranny of her ass up close..and it was really a lot to take in lol.

Alicia Keys does her poem speech and Fifth Harmony was in my direct line of sight and I'm cracking up at Lauren acting like she was at church with every line she spoke. [This was her.](https://media.giphy.com/media/jHS6opL3pzkKQ/giphy.gif)

Next up was Future and that was by far the worst performance of the night (besides the hosts and skits that were highly unnecessary). For how hyped up Future's music is, hoooollly shit does he give NO energy. That Future performance was a test of my willpower to stand there and survive. Right before he started, this random girl and I both started freaking out like ""omg this is about to be so wild"" and then he finished and we both looked at each other like ""well, that was a thing that took place.""

Kanye comes out and just seemed like he was having a total blast being there. During commercial breaks, he's literally talking to everyone and cuddling in his seats with Kim, it was so cute tbh. I was happy that Kanye was happy and the world is a better place when Kanye is happy. He was getting heckled by some drunk asshole across the stadium which he responded to during his speech but overall, a good night for Yeezy. The music video was fun to watch too. Teyana Taylor killed. It was fun to hear the whole arena catch their life and then go into sounds of confusion when she became a cat lady.

Nick Jonas does Bacon outside the arena and the part where he's in the diner was entirely pre-taped, just in case it didn't seem obvious lol. DNCE shows up in it and they were sitting in the audience in the theater while it was airing, the only live part was the end when he's performing outside with Ty Dolla $ign.

Commercial break hits and we see the set people bring out a billion electric fans and that's my cue that it's Beyonce time and I am internally losing my shit. You can feel the crowd just losing their minds in preparation. Beyonce comes on and I'm so close to her that I can see the makeup on her skin and I am destroyed. Hold Up to Countdown made my skin stand up. When she came back near me and did Formation, I felt like my soul was gonna fly to the ceiling. She fucking did THAT. Best performance of the night, but you didn't even have to be there to feel that. 

Fifth Harmony won an award and the whole time I thought Ally was gonna fall. She tripped on her dress 3 times throughout the night, the audience kept getting nervous for her lol. That would've been tragic (and hilarious ngl). There's a part of the show (I think during a commercial break) where Dinah was right in front of me so I just called her name and said hi. She was really sweet and said hi and said that she was really sweaty. I didn't know what to say to that so I just laughed lol. 

At this point, they announce Britney is next and I am S H O O K. I get the feeling from reading comments about the show that Beyonce killed the vibe for Britney at home because she was so good but that was not the case for the audience at the show. I feel like that Beyonce performance just helped keep the vibe going and everyone around me was super excited. Britney comes on and I'm gonna be embarrassing here but I started tearing up lol. I wasn't like hardcore crying or anything but it just made me emotional! It was just a sensory overload from seeing Rih all those times and then Beyonce killing me and once Britney coming out of that silhouette bringing me back to life (also probably me being the stan that I am). I'm in the audience dancing and lowkey wiping away baby tears lol. I was S C R E A M I N G. I thought she completely killed. [I 100% felt like this clip of Tinashe describing the performance.](https://twitter.com/EbsRob89/status/770113471572836353). I couldn't wait to get back and come here and talk about it and then I log on and all of you are shitting on it lmfaoooo. I guess it just came through differently in person. Everyone around me thought she killed and I guess it was hard to feel the energy from the TV. It wasn't Beyonce or Rih but it was probably the third hypest performance of the night. I also noticed that G-Eazy was trying to kiss her, I couldn't tell if that was staged or not I just remember actually saying out loud ""omg they're gonna kiss!"" and then she completely deads him. It was hilarious.

I watched the Olympic gymnasts get really excited because they took pictures with Kim Kardashian, it was really cute. They were really excited to be there - I was happy for them. Actually throughout the night, it seemed like everyone in the audience was trying to get a picture with Kim. There were literally lines at some points of the show of people waiting to get selfies with her, like a meet &amp; greet. 5H were on one of the lines lmfao. 

Chainsmokers and Halsey come out and perform and I thought it was a mess vocally for Halsey. It sounded like screeching in the arena. I also read that singing Chainsmoker was also tragic but I thought he was lipsyncing the whole time there. I didn't hear his mic feed at all in the arena - I only heard the backing track, but I guess his mic feed came off on TV. 

Jimmy Fallon does that Ryan Lochte skit and it's getting an eh reaction. I was watching Kanye and he really couldn't care less. 

and finally, Drake comes out to give Rihanna that award and it's the most adorable thing on the planet. He's reading his little speech and I'm in direct view of the teleprompter and I read that he's gonna say he's in love with her before he said it and I gasped lol. It diiid look like she was curving him both times he went for the kiss though.
When Rihanna was giving his speech, he was standing right on top of me in front of me and I was in direct view of his ass. Gotta say it looks solid - a 9/10.

All and all, it was a iconic life-shaking concert for me. I was extremely close and didn't have to spend a dime. I got to watch performers that I love do their damn thing. I don't even wanna watch the regular show on TV because I don't want to ruin the memory, since what I've been reading was that it was just okay. I was sitting on the train, heading back home, exasperated from what I just witnessed. I'm forever eternally slayed.

edit: I forgot to add that I saw Mac Miller &amp; Ariana sitting kissing the whole time, just a lot of PDA, and ngl it was pretty gross lol. &gt;Nick Jonas does Bacon outside the arena and the part where he's in the diner was entirely pre-taped, just in case it didn't seem obvious lol. DNCE shows up in it and they were sitting in the audience in the theater while it was airing, the only live part was the end when he's performing outside with Ty Dolla $ign.

I'm currently filling a new playlist with an upbeat/fashion kind of theme going on, the type of emotion you get when you walk around town looking fly and the outfit being 10/10 kind of vibe.

I literally only have one song in it now (I know I'm terrible) Not sure how to upload pics when submitting a textpost on AlienBlue but it's Fashion by The Royal Concept ([it's amaaazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJJjv8sYsiE))!

So my question is, would any of you have any songs that are your go to sassy/walk like you own the damn place vibe? Preferably pop but I don't discriminate! 

Spotify had one of those playlists but it hasn't been updated in months and it's really aggressive I guess? (kanye West ""Powers"" kind of feeling).

[Leave \(Get Out\) - Jojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWyUEuGcWY)

* 00s hit that is about as throwback-worthy as it gets. Jojo was 13 when this came out, which I had no idea about until about 5 mins ago. There's something about the attitude in this song and female 00s pop in general that gets me, idk why tho

[Ma'ak Bartaah - Amr Diab](https://open.spotify.com/track/5XMHMPBq5tzA7hLTR5lPJ1)

* iTunes Radio (the old one, RIP) used to have a playlist called Spin the Globe which had all this cool music from around the world (and is how I found my fave Stromae). Can't find most of the songs from that anymore but still have this one. Just a super catchy tune

[Stayin' Alive - Bee Gees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_izvAbhExY)

* My dad is a massive Bee Gees fan, and they were one of the first artists I ever listened to. In fact, my karaoke go-to at family events as a kid was Tragedy. Stayin' Alive is one of my faves and is go-to whenever I'm walking around

[Cry For You - September](https://open.spotify.com/track/1mvZErZBp7WZT3HfGBykao)

* Another throwback-worthy tune and is a classic example of the simplicity and catchy-ness of early/mid 00s dance-pop

[Moustache - Twin Twin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWJFfnHNOWI)

* Whoops, here's a Eurovision song. I've been a massive fan of Eurovision since I started watching in 2007 and this is a song from a couple years back. While it does irk me a bit that it's quite similar to Stromae's ['Papaoutai'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiKj0Z_Xnjc), I still like it and am a bit annoyed at how awful the [live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjkqciwP034) was I feel like such a fucking hipster with this series of songs.

“Queen of taking the long way home.” - BreezySeason

Sort of like Run Away With Me’s chippier younger sister, but it takes away that thing that makes Run Away With Me so good: that feeling of this dark, mysterious world expanding endlessly around you, as well as the security Carly brings you by sounding like she’s by your side every step of the way. This just sounds like a cute song you’d listen to for a drive through the city. It doesn’t have the gravitas for me, I guess.

“If I didn't give my 11 to When I Needed You it might have gone to this one purely for encapsulating everything about the kind of hopeless romanticism and almost naive optimism and excitement that Carly and I have in common,” says TheAllRightGatsby, making me feel like a bit of a jerk. KometBlu says, “Loving the chill 80's teas and the sax accents in this. Always heard some Whitney Houston influences all over the track. Really love it. Except of that synth at the start which sounds like a child lullaby, delete it.” Agreed, the beginning is kinda the worst part.

breadvelvet also has a long blurb, saying, “hey, ‘Your Type’, this is how you handle the four chord structure, with sparkly production, a bouncy bass line, a prominent saxophone part, and a chorus that just begs to be sung out with a crowd. Other than those components, it’s pretty average tho lmao.” Watch out, snidelaughter has the banhammer ready. TeamAwesome4 calls it “Literally the cutest song in the world,” as if cuter songs didn’t exist on the same album. eklxtreme says the “melody doesn’t do much,” and MisterrAlex comes through with the pathos: “This song is absolutely amazing, can you just picture yourself driving down a highway with Carly singing this in your ear? Just picture that and you can see how glorious this song is.” And of course, MrSwearword throws some shade, saying, “A game of ‘let’s get lost’? you first, Carly…” ",Your Type,Carly Rae Jepsen,75.0,77.7777777777777,"[""chill 80's teas"", 'sax accents', 'sparkly production', 'bouncy bass line', 'prominent saxophone part', 'four chord structure']","['Run Away With Me’s chippier younger sister', 'Whitney Houston influences']","['a drive through the city', 'driving down a highway with Carly singing']","['hopeless romanticism', 'almost naive optimism and excitement', 'feeling of this dark, mysterious world expanding endlessly around you', 'security Carly brings you by sounding like she’s by your side every step of the way', 'cute song', 'pathos']",,"['controversy scores are a measure of how divisive the voting was', 'average controversy score is 2', 'songs with higher scores']","[['When I Needed You', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Gimme Love', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Dangerous Woman', 'Ariana Grande'], ['LA Hallucinations', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['I Really Like You', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Be Alright', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Warm Blood', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Touch It', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Wildest Dreams', 'Taylor Swift'], [""I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance"", 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['All That', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['New Romantics', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Moonlight', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Fever', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Bad Decisions', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Favourite Colour', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Thinking Bout You', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Clean', 'Taylor Swift'], ['First Time', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Love Again', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Never Get to Hold You', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Side to Side', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Sometimes', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Leave Me Lonely', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Knew Better/Forever Boy', 'Ariana Grande'], ['I Know Places', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Out of the Woods', 'Taylor Swift'], ['All You Had to Do Was Stay', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Everyday', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Wonderland', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Let Me Love You', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Black Heart', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], [""I Don't Care"", 'Ariana Grande'], [""Jason's Song (Gave it Away)"", 'Ariana Grande'], ['Step On Up', 'Ariana Grande'], ['This Love', 'Taylor Swift'], ['I Wish You Would', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Shake It Off', 'Taylor Swift'], ['How You Get the Girl', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Focus', 'Ariana Grande'], ['You Are in Love', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Welcome to New York', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Bad Blood', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Blank Space', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Style', 'Taylor Swift'], ['Run Away With Me', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Emotion', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Boy Problems', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Making the Most of the Night', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Your Type', 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], [""Let's Get Lost"", 'Carly Rae Jepsen'], ['Into You', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Greedy', 'Ariana Grande']]","Chill 80's teas with sax accents and a bouncy bass line create a sparkly production featuring a prominent saxophone part and a four chord structure.

Like [the previous rate thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/4xmic6/rate_1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman/) by the GOAT /u/letsallpoo, we're going to all get together and score each song off of each of three albums (if you haven’t realized by now, I’m also copying /u/Altiondsols’s rate thread).

Rules are the same as the other rate threads, but here's a refresher:

1. Listen to the songs below.  Links provided whenever possible.

2. Rate each song from 1 to 10, 1 being awful and 10 being perfect.  You can also give ONE eleven and ONE zero, to your favorite and least favorite songs respectively (across your entire scoring, not per album).  If you want, you can leave comments alongside your scores, and they will be revealed along with the songs.

3. PM your scores to /u/fuckupsomecommasyeah (me), by September 30th, along with any comments you'd wish to add (not required but always appreciated).  You can copy and paste the lists into a Word doc/Notepad/whatever, add your scores, and send them to me.  Your scores and comments should *not* be considered anonymous.

4. The scores will be revealed in order from lowest to highest.

5. Everyone is perfectly fine because no one here has any actual emotional attachment to some silly contest like this, everyone acts like adults and no one cries when their ~~indie princess~~ fave completely tanks, we all get along with no issues whatsoever :) :) :)

The three albums we're going to look at this time around are:

**Katy Perry – Teenage Dream** (The Complete Confection edition)

vs

**Lady Gaga – The Fame Monster** (The Fame edition)

vs

**Kesha – Animal + Cannibal** (combined edition)

let’s get started, shall we?

#Katy Perry – Teenage Dream

Katy Perry, as you all know, is one of the biggest popstars in the world, and Teenage Dream was the album that solidified her status. During the Teenage Dream era, she became known for her [bright](https://popofcouture.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/td1.png), [candy-coated](http://static.idolator.com/uploads/2010/06/katy-perry2.gif) aesthetic. Teenage Dream’s sales, records, and certifications speak for themselves. The album has sold 3 million copies in the US and 6 million worldwide. It charted within the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 year-end chart three years in a row. The album earned Katy seven Grammy nominations, for which she was tragically snubbed. She also was the first female artist to produce five #1 singles from the same album (#JusticeForTheOneThatGotAway), and the first artist overall since Michael Jackson’s 1987 album Bad.

Katy would release Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection nearly two years later; the single Part Of Me debuted at #1 and went double platinum. It also features a remix of E.T. featuring Kanye West that had already been made for the release of the E.T. music video. (This is the version of the album that we will be rating!)

#Lady Gaga – The Fame Monster

Before she became the biggest star on the planet, before she fell from grace, before she broke tons of records and then her hip, before she became a jazz/rock/tribute singer/artist/farmer, before Applause, Bad Romance, Born This Way, and Just Dance took over the charts, there was a 5' 1'' singer with big sunglasses and even bigger heels singing her heart out at bars and [water parks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA8bt4xDqCo), trying to promote an album that debuted at #17 on the Billboard 200. We always joke that music was invented in 2009 with the release of The Fame, but for a lot of us - including me - that's really where our love for music began. Without Gaga, and without that album, I wouldn't have realized how great, how limitless pop music had the potential to be, and I certainly wouldn't be on this subreddit now if it weren't for that. Maybe those songs (yes, even Bad Romance) sound a bit dated now, but I can't help but smile when I relisten to The Fame and The Fame Monster and remember my days in middle school spending hours watching Gaga performances on YouTube, when she still had that disco stick and a decent number of straight fans. It really was an exciting time for pop music, and I can only hope to experience something similar again someday. (by /u/letsallpoo)

#Ke$ha – Animal + Cannibal

With the news of what Ke$ha endured during these years with Dr. Luke surfacing recently, it's hard to look at the Animal and Cannibal eras fondly. Those albums introduced us to Ke$ha, in all her glitter-soaked vomit-stained glory, whose public persona belied a legitimately talented and intelligent songwriter and singer who was secretly suffering at the hands of the man in charge of her career. She was a master of the trashy pop song, but she could also be strikingly sensitive - song like The Harold Song and Dancing With Tears in my Eyes come to mind. At the very least, those were the years where she was a constant on the radio and the charts, and with her current career in limbo, I still wonder what will happen next for her. Ke$ha truly deserved better, from all of us. (by /u/letsallpoo)

Some potential topics up for discussion:

* What was your favorite/least favorite tracks?

* What elements stood out to you while listening to this album?

* Has this music act improved from their previous work?

* Would you say this album is your album of the year? Your least favorite album of the year? Neither?

* How can this act improve if they were to release more work, potentially another album? First listen done, and HOLY SHIT.

I liked Bastille casually, and Pompeii was fun. I didn't really find Bad Blood to be that good. I only listened it because I was reading through this thread, and man, I really enjoy every song on this. I was worried they couldn't hold the momentum throughout the whole thing since it's super long, but every song is great IMO. There's a ton of songs I wouldn't expect them to do on here, like Way Beyond and Oil on Water (THOSE HORNS) and they really do a great job of adding a lot of flair to the whole thing. It's just amazing how solid it is the whole way through. Also, shoutout to the little skits, they're totally awesome and not annoying like some skits are. They're all the right amount of time and add a lot to the song.

Definitely one of the most enjoyable first listens I've had this year, and I'm happily surprised that Bastille can hang around with some of my favorite indie pop releases this year. If you haven't listened already, please do. This is guaranteed to bring a smile to the indie kids and the pop lovers.",Pompeii,Bastille,85.7142857142857,83.3333333333333,"['THOSE HORNS', 'flair in the whole album', 'little skits are awesome and not annoying', 'skits add a lot to the song']",['Bastille can hang around with some indie pop releases'],['first listen of the album'],"['brings a smile to indie kids and pop lovers', 'enjoyable first listen']",,"[""Bastille's album is long"", 'solid album all the way through']","[['Wild World', 'Bastille'], ['Pompeii', 'Bastille'], ['Bad Blood', 'Bastille'], ['Way Beyond', 'Bastille'], ['Oil on Water', 'Bastille']]","Bastille's album, which is long and solid all the way through, features a flair that stands out across the whole record.

Hey wassup, long time lurker and occasional poster in popheads mainly because I don't have quite the same taste as the majority of the common posters here, so I merely read and enjoy the flamboyancy at times. 

But, as time has gone on, I have come to learn that the fanbase of the queen of hating celery is not to be trifled with, and it's time I judged this so called ""Greatest Album of All Time"" with my own ears and see how I like it compared to what I've heard.

As a little preface I've only heard two songs on the album a few times before: I Really Like You and Run Away With Me. Personally, I hated I Really Like You and loved Run Away With Me, but I will still be critiquing them all the same for all of you to enjoy. And of course, I will use an arbitrary numbering system that means nothing &lt;3



**1. Run Away With Me** - I absolutely adore the saxophone intro, and then the quick and refreshing beat. The lyrics are so whimsical and relatable, I can totally imagine myself wanting to say some of these things to someone I care for. The choruses are so infectious and fun, I always want to sing along whenever I hear it. Great song. The video is also really good as it shows her consistently giving me bedroom eyes, which I very much enjoy. 

**Rating:** 17/15 - Pretty much pop perfection



**2. E-MO-TION** - Ah, the song the album is named after, well, let's hear it. Oooooh, I like the disco-y vibe with the background instruments. Ah a breakup song. I love the beat and the vibe, she doesn't even seem bitter, she just kind of misses him. I'm really digging the chorus. (I might be misinterpreting it, sorry if I am :P) I can totally relate though, still having feelings and not really sure what to do with the emotions that were left behind after the breakup. I really enjoyed this bop. 

**Rating:** 964/1000 - I really enjoy the lyrics and the arrangement. Definitely close to Run Away With Me. 



**3. I Really Like You** - Ah, yes, the dreaded song, let's see if my opinion has changed since the last time. Tom Hanks was an odd choice. I like the drums in the background. The lyrics are sort of relatable, but I lose it in the chorus which seems just so juvenile. I CAN relate, but the word choice is just a bit too cringe for me to enjoy the song. It's fun, it's light, but I wouldn't choose it over the previous two songs by a long shot.

**Rating:** 4/8 - Juvenile, but catchy.



**4. Gimmie Love** - Hmm, softer intro. I really like the first verse. Relatable and wanting what you want and it being hard to control. But I lost it during the chorus, not a big fan of the repeating words constantly in the intro, has the same problem I Really Like You does for me. The arrangement is okay with this one, but I'm not really noticing it that much. Verses good, chorus bad. The ending is pretty good though. I need more Carly cooing and less Carly belting it out.

**Rating:** 53/90 - Not a bad song, but again, something I wouldn't listen to consistently. 



**5. All That** - Ooh, the intro sound very 80's, I'm liking it so far. I like the slowness and the electronic keyboard in the background. This is literally what I just asked for, Carly cooing. I really enjoy the mellow vibe and the soothing tone. This entire song is just working for me right now. Even when she starts belting it out by the end, I feel like she's earned it this time, like she's trying to enforce this point and she's turning a bit desperate. I like it. Lyrics are a bit confusing for me, but they aren't that bad. 

**Rating:** 11/13 - Good vibes, lovely singing, definitely made me happy listening to it.



**6. Boy Problems** - This feels like it's even earlier than 80's, it reminds me of Cyndi Lauper. I actually kinda like the lyrics, even if they are so teenager, getting sick of your friends complaining to you about their relationship issues. I'm sad she cut her hair in the music video. :&lt; Other than that the video is pretty safe. I'm not really digging the song that much, it vibes a bit, but the lyrics just don't really relate to me that much, because although I had friends that would complain about their boyfriends, it was never all the time, so I wouldn't really get annoyed. I dunno, seems a bit caddy.

**Rating:** 30/66 - Uninteresting lyrics mixed with an okay arrangement. Not my favorite song.



**7. Making the Most of the Night** - Ooh, loving the drums. Oh I think I've heard Sia's version of this song. I don't really remember it. Ooooh, that vibe in the bridge to the chorus, I am loving it. The chorus is alright, the highlight is Carly's voice obviously. But the best part of this song is easily the verses and bridges just so vibey and I love the buildup. The payoff isn't the best, but I don't really mind with this song. Ooooooh, that third verse though. It's getting me so hyped. I like the little outro too, a nice addition that didn't need to be added but it worked. 

**Rating:** 70/88 - A really fun song with an alright chorus. 



**8. Your Type** - Odd start with the narration in the video. I like the arrangement. Reminds me A LOT of Do What U Want by Lady Gaga. The lyrics aren't bad, the chorus isn't too bad. I'm not really too sure what she's trying to say with the song. I think she's confused which I guess makes sense in a strange way. It's a pretty safe song. The video started off weird, but kind of settled back down in a safe setting. 

**Rating:** 104/186 - Catchy beat, okay lyrically. Safe.



**9. Let's Get Lost** - Haha, fun intro, sounds like a game. Ooooh vibe-y, loving the instruments. CARLY COOING RETURNS! Oooooh fresh beat. Damn this is good. I'm loving everything about this song right now. Chorus is catchy, verses are soothing, beat is amazing. I have to say it again, damn this is good. I'm going to have to listen to E-MO-TION again to see which I prefer. 

**Rating:** 520/510 - Super catchy, fun and amazing beat. Love it.



**10. LA Hallucinations** - Hmmm, interesting intro. Still not sure how to feel 20 seconds in. Pretty decent beat. I'm not quite sure what the song is about. I like the chorus, not too big on the verses. It's meh, not awful, not amazing. It's not really safe either, it just isn't really working for me. Alright song

**Rating:** 8/17 - Odd, sort of catchy. Just alright I guess



**11. Warm Blood** - Oooh whispering. Decent beat. Almost too little is happening right now. Oh I like this chorus though. Catchy. Weird leave from the chorus though with the voice alteration. This song is just kind of really strange. I'm not sure if it's working for me or not. I'm liking the background arrangement a bit more. I'm not actually quite sure what the song is about besides enjoying the feeling of touch from others. I like the whispering, but it's a bit too much here. 

**Rating:** 46/64 - Neat song with a good chorus but takes a few risks that I feel don't work with the song. 



**12. When I Needed You** - Interesting beginning, I'm liking the beat and the drums. Pretty 80's or even earlier. I'm enjoying the hyping up in the verses, the chorus is pretty decent too. It's reminds me of the songs you'd hear at the end of 80's movies, it's kinda cheesy but not in a bad way. I'm digging it, it's definitely decent. It makes me feel really nostalgic. 

**Rating:** 72/90 - Fun, nostalgic, a bit cheesy, but decent and does the job. 



**13. Black Heart** - Oooh chiptune-y. Hmm, I was expecting it to build a bit more, but it's not really. Lyrics are, odd. Singing is good but I don't know if it really fits with the background music. The arrangement is starting to bore me :P. This is still definitely 80's, I just am not a big fan of this part of the 80's music-wise. Meh.

**Rating:** 1068/2222 - Too little for me to stay interested throughout the song. The message is also muddled in the lyrics.



**14. I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance** - Ooh. Sultry. Carly Cooing returns! Good vibe with the arrangement, I'm definitely digging it. OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS CHORUS. Gives me the chills in all the right ways. MMM I'm vibing out right now. Oh god this is doing everything right for me right now. I want to start clapping along. The verses do the right amount of hyping and the choruses work of it perfectly. 

**Rating:** 887/888 - Great vibes, pretty close to pop perfection.



**15. Favourite Colour** - Imogen Heap vibes right off the bat. Pretty chill, I don't mind it. I really like the chorus. The belting works here for me. It seems really honest. More honest than a lot of the songs, I actually like it. Lyrics are earnest. Beat is decent, arrangement is nice. It feels like this is a song of something admitting all their feelings to someone, and the good feelings that can come with that. I like the synth. 

**Rating:** 1345/1390 - Really nice song, something I'd really put on a chill-out mix maybe. Really honest.



**16. Never Get to Hold You** - Oooh, more Carly cooing. Chills. Good vibes. The arrangement is definitely working me up to something. Another song that reminds me of Do What U Want, but I like this one a bit better. Got a good beat and I like the lyrics. They relate to me a lot more, regretting something you said almost immediately after you said it. I really like the vibes in this song. Good arrangement. Just nice.

**Rating:** 71/79 - Warmed me up a bit, really something to vibe out to. Nice song.



**17. Love Again** - Oh, I'm liking the way this is starting. This synth is really catchy. Her voice is amazing in this song. I like the chorus, this really feels like the finale of an album. I love it. I'm jamming out to this song right now. It's not the best song on the album but I am really enjoying it. It makes me wistful and nostalgic about the album I just listened to, and makes me want to listen to it again. 

**Rating:** 99/99.9 - A higher rating than it deserves, but it makes me enjoy the album even more.



Well, that's all of E-MO-TION. Actually a really good album. However, I'm not done yet, I'm going to do Side B too!

**1. First Time** - Oooh, k this is really Cyndi Lauper. ""I don't care"". I'm liking the lyrics, and the beat and arrangement. Pretty jamming, super 80's. Pretty decent bop, fun but a bit forgetful.

**Rating:** - 81/93 - Fun, catchy, good beat. Pinnacle of the 80's



**2. Higher** - Oh k this I like. Another arrangement reminiscent of Do What U Want. I'm liking the chorus. Makes me really feel like she's talking to me. This song just makes me want to look up pictures of Carly smiling. I'm loving the vibe in the verses. I really like the third verse. ""Gets me higher"". I feel like this album would be amazing on drugs. 

**Rating:** 175/205 - Catchy, good solid beat. I enjoyed it. 



**3. The One** - Ok yes. This intro is perfection. Perfect beat. More Carly Cooing! I LOVE the arrangement of this song. Her voice just vibes so well with the production of this song. Pure ecstasy. Jamming really hard right now. I like how this song is giving a much different message than the rest of the songs on both albums. It's very in the moment and ignoring the consequences of her actions which I very much like. Top notch. 

**Rating:** 99/102 - Really close to perfect in every aspect, there's just something that doesn't top the top three songs of E-MO-TION.



**4. Fever** - Another song that I really like the intro of. Another sultry song. This song is super 80's too. I'm vibing with this a lot. Really quite enjoy it. The soft verses and the bombastic chorus complement each other nicely. The lyrics are pretty alright, but I'm not really paying attention to them, I'm jamming to the music. 

**Rating:** 85/90 - Bop!



**5. Body Language** - I'm not really sure what to say, it's pretty entertaining! The arrangement is pretty 80's too. Not a huge fan of how she's pronouncing Body Language. Lyrics are pretty relatable, I'm enjoying the song more as it goes on, I like the background ""Oooooooh"" calls. 

**Rating:** 77/100 - Decent and fun.



**6. Cry** - Ok a sad song. Or not. Definitely lower than the rest of the songs. Ah a song about frustration towards your significant other. It's nice, not really amazing. I'm enjoying the arrangement, but not much beyond that, kind of boring for me. Forgettable

**Rating**: 502/1079 - Good beat, but I really wasn't engaged. 



**7. Store** - I like the softer intro. It's soothing. Carly cooing makes her triumphant return. More 80's vibes. Oh ouch. I do not like that chorus. Sounds really juvenile. Ruined the nice verse. It also just doesn't fit with the rest of the song pretty much at all. I would have really liked this song without that annoying chorus.

**Rating:** 101/257 - Besides the chorus, nice song! Soothing and relaxing



**8. Roses** - Oh another calm song. Carly's cooing finale. I like it so far. Simple yet effective. Oh a nice transition into the chorus. This song makes me feel nice. The arrangement, the lyrics, the beat, and the singing all really works for me. Probably my favorite slower song next to maybe Let's Get Lost. Yes, a good finale to Side B, not as good a finale as Love Again, but pretty good in it's own right.

**Rating:** 8/9 - Made me happy, and I loved pretty much everything about it. 




And that's Side B!

Overall I actually really liked both of these albums, and although there were a few songs I didn't care for, they were all produced very well and all had something that I liked about them. Really A+ job Carly, you have a new stan! \*Goes back to putting Run Away With Me and Let's Get Lost on repeat\* I don't think I can forgive you for not realizing the perfection that is Making The Most of the Night.

**Rating:** 520/510 - Super catchy, fun and amazing beat. Love it.



**10. LA Hallucinations** - Hmmm, interesting intro. Still not sure how to feel 20 seconds in. Pretty decent beat. I'm not quite sure what the song is about. I like the chorus, not too big on the verses. It's meh, not awful, not amazing. It's not really safe either, it just isn't really working for me. Alright song

**Rating:** 8/17 - Odd, sort of catchy. Just alright I guess



**11. Warm Blood** - Oooh whispering. Decent beat. Almost too little is happening right now. Oh I like this chorus though. Catchy. Weird leave from the chorus though with the voice alteration. This song is just kind of really strange. I'm not sure if it's working for me or not. I'm liking the background arrangement a bit more. I'm not actually quite sure what the song is about besides enjoying the feeling of touch from others. I like the whispering, but it's a bit too much here. 

**Rating:** 46/64 - Neat song with a good chorus but takes a few risks that I feel don't work with the song. 



**12. When I Needed You** - Interesting beginning, I'm liking the beat and the drums. Pretty 80's or even earlier. I'm enjoying the hyping up in the verses, the chorus is pretty decent too. It's reminds me of the songs you'd hear at the end of 80's movies, it's kinda cheesy but not in a bad way. I'm digging it, it's definitely decent. It makes me feel really nostalgic. 

**Rating:** 72/90 - Fun, nostalgic, a bit cheesy, but decent and does the job. 



**13. Black Heart** - Oooh chiptune-y. Hmm, I was expecting it to build a bit more, but it's not really. Lyrics are, odd. Singing is good but I don't know if it really fits with the background music. The arrangement is starting to bore me :P. This is still definitely 80's, I just am not a big fan of this part of the 80's music-wise. Meh.

**Rating:** 1068/2222 - Too little for me to stay interested throughout the song. The message is also muddled in the lyrics.



**14. I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance** - Ooh. Sultry. Carly Cooing returns! Good vibe with the arrangement, I'm definitely digging it. OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS CHORUS. Gives me the chills in all the right ways. MMM I'm vibing out right now. Oh god this is doing everything right for me right now. I want to start clapping along. The verses do the right amount of hyping and the choruses work of it perfectly. 

**Rating:** 887/888 - Great vibes, pretty close to pop perfection.



**15. Favourite Colour** - Imogen Heap vibes right off the bat. Pretty chill, I don't mind it. I really like the chorus. The belting works here for me. It seems really honest. More honest than a lot of the songs, I actually like it. Lyrics are earnest. Beat is decent, arrangement is nice. It feels like this is a song of something admitting all their feelings to someone, and the good feelings that can come with that. I like the synth. 

**Rating:** 1345/1390 - Really nice song, something I'd really put on a chill-out mix maybe. Really honest.



**16. Never Get to Hold You** - Oooh, more Carly cooing. Chills. Good vibes. The arrangement is definitely working me up to something. Another song that reminds me of Do What U Want, but I like this one a bit better. Got a good beat and I like the lyrics. They relate to me a lot more, regretting something you said almost immediately after you said it. I really like the vibes in this song. Good arrangement. Just nice.

**Rating:** 71/79 - Warmed me up a bit, really something to vibe out to. Nice song.



**17. Love Again** - Oh, I'm liking the way this is starting. This synth is really catchy. Her voice is amazing in this song. I like the chorus, this really feels like the finale of an album. I love it. I'm jamming out to this song right now. It's not the best song on the album but I am really enjoying it. It makes me wistful and nostalgic about the album I just listened to, and makes me want to listen to it again. 

**Rating:** 99/99.9 - A higher rating than it deserves, but it makes me enjoy the album even more.



Well, that's all of E-MO-TION. Actually a really good album. However, I'm not done yet, I'm going to do Side B too!

**1. First Time** - Oooh, k this is really Cyndi Lauper. ""I don't care"". I'm liking the lyrics, and the beat and arrangement. Pretty jamming, super 80's. Pretty decent bop, fun but a bit forgetful.

**Rating:** - 81/93 - Fun, catchy, good beat. Pinnacle of the 80's



**2. Higher** - Oh k this I like. Another arrangement reminiscent of Do What U Want. I'm liking the chorus. Makes me really feel like she's talking to me. This song just makes me want to look up pictures of Carly smiling. I'm loving the vibe in the verses. I really like the third verse. ""Gets me higher"". I feel like this album would be amazing on drugs. 

**Rating:** 175/205 - Catchy, good solid beat. I enjoyed it. 



**3. The One** - Ok yes. This intro is perfection. Perfect beat. More Carly Cooing! I LOVE the arrangement of this song. Her voice just vibes so well with the production of this song. Pure ecstasy. Jamming really hard right now. I like how this song is giving a much different message than the rest of the songs on both albums. It's very in the moment and ignoring the consequences of her actions which I very much like. Top notch. 

**Rating:** 99/102 - Really close to perfect in every aspect, there's just something that doesn't top the top three songs of E-MO-TION.



**4. Fever** - Another song that I really like the intro of. Another sultry song. This song is super 80's too. I'm vibing with this a lot. Really quite enjoy it. The soft verses and the bombastic chorus complement each other nicely. The lyrics are pretty alright, but I'm not really paying attention to them, I'm jamming to the music. 

**Rating:** 85/90 - Bop!



**5. Body Language** - I'm not really sure what to say, it's pretty entertaining! The arrangement is pretty 80's too. Not a huge fan of how she's pronouncing Body Language. Lyrics are pretty relatable, I'm enjoying the song more as it goes on, I like the background ""Oooooooh"" calls. 

**Rating:** 77/100 - Decent and fun.



**6. Cry** - Ok a sad song. Or not. Definitely lower than the rest of the songs. Ah a song about frustration towards your significant other. It's nice, not really amazing. I'm enjoying the arrangement, but not much beyond that, kind of boring for me. Forgettable

**Rating**: 502/1079 - Good beat, but I really wasn't engaged. 



**7. Store** - I like the softer intro. It's soothing. Carly cooing makes her triumphant return. More 80's vibes. Oh ouch. I do not like that chorus. Sounds really juvenile. Ruined the nice verse. It also just doesn't fit with the rest of the song pretty much at all. I would have really liked this song without that annoying chorus.

**Rating:** 101/257 - Besides the chorus, nice song! Soothing and relaxing



**8. Roses** - Oh another calm song. Carly's cooing finale. I like it so far. Simple yet effective. Oh a nice transition into the chorus. This song makes me feel nice. The arrangement, the lyrics, the beat, and the singing all really works for me. Probably my favorite slower song next to maybe Let's Get Lost. Yes, a good finale to Side B, not as good a finale as Love Again, but pretty good in it's own right.

**Rating:** 8/9 - Made me happy, and I loved pretty much everything about it. 




And that's Side B! 

Overall I can't do a best to worst list for the songs because so many of them are so close, but I can separate them into tiers!

Overall I actually really liked both of these albums, and although there were a few songs I didn't care for, they were all produced very well and all had something that I liked about them. Really A+ job Carly, you have a new stan! \*Goes back to putting Run Away With Me and Let's Get Lost on repeat\* I don't think I can forgive you for not realizing the perfection that is Making The Most of the Night.

250,133209.0,popheads,/data2/rsalgani/reddit/spotify_json/popheads/133209_21_7wgxq27uOvfydLunYkcmAU.json,/data2/rsalgani/reddit/json_temps/popheads/133209.json,/data2/rsalgani/reddit/spotify_mp3/7wgxq27uOvfydLunYkcmAU.mp3,/data2/rsalgani/reddit/test_sets/test_set_May6/package/1min_audio/7wgxq27uOvfydLunYkcmAU.mp3,"I listen to E-MO-TION for the first time and critique each track! Hey wassup, long time lurker and occasional poster in popheads mainly because I don't have quite the same taste as the majority of the common posters here, so I merely read and enjoy the flamboyancy at times. 

But, as time has gone on, I have come to learn that the fanbase of the queen of hating celery is not to be trifled with, and it's time I judged this so called ""Greatest Album of All Time"" with my own ears and see how I like it compared to what I've heard.

As a little preface I've only heard two songs on the album a few times before: I Really Like You and Run Away With Me. Personally, I hated I Really Like You and loved Run Away With Me, but I will still be critiquing them all the same for all of you to enjoy. And of course, I will use an arbitrary numbering system that means nothing &lt;3



**1. Run Away With Me** - I absolutely adore the saxophone intro, and then the quick and refreshing beat. The lyrics are so whimsical and relatable, I can totally imagine myself wanting to say some of these things to someone I care for. The choruses are so infectious and fun, I always want to sing along whenever I hear it. Great song. The video is also really good as it shows her consistently giving me bedroom eyes, which I very much enjoy. 

**Rating:** 17/15 - Pretty much pop perfection



**2. E-MO-TION** - Ah, the song the album is named after, well, let's hear it. Oooooh, I like the disco-y vibe with the background instruments. Ah a breakup song. I love the beat and the vibe, she doesn't even seem bitter, she just kind of misses him. I'm really digging the chorus. (I might be misinterpreting it, sorry if I am :P) I can totally relate though, still having feelings and not really sure what to do with the emotions that were left behind after the breakup. I really enjoyed this bop. 

**Rating:** 964/1000 - I really enjoy the lyrics and the arrangement. Definitely close to Run Away With Me. 



**3. I Really Like You** - Ah, yes, the dreaded song, let's see if my opinion has changed since the last time. Tom Hanks was an odd choice. I like the drums in the background. The lyrics are sort of relatable, but I lose it in the chorus which seems just so juvenile. I CAN relate, but the word choice is just a bit too cringe for me to enjoy the song. It's fun, it's light, but I wouldn't choose it over the previous two songs by a long shot.

**Rating:** 4/8 - Juvenile, but catchy.



**4. Gimmie Love** - Hmm, softer intro. I really like the first verse. Relatable and wanting what you want and it being hard to control. But I lost it during the chorus, not a big fan of the repeating words constantly in the intro, has the same problem I Really Like You does for me. The arrangement is okay with this one, but I'm not really noticing it that much. Verses good, chorus bad. The ending is pretty good though. I need more Carly cooing and less Carly belting it out.

**Rating:** 53/90 - Not a bad song, but again, something I wouldn't listen to consistently. 



**5. All That** - Ooh, the intro sound very 80's, I'm liking it so far. I like the slowness and the electronic keyboard in the background. This is literally what I just asked for, Carly cooing. I really enjoy the mellow vibe and the soothing tone. This entire song is just working for me right now. Even when she starts belting it out by the end, I feel like she's earned it this time, like she's trying to enforce this point and she's turning a bit desperate. I like it. Lyrics are a bit confusing for me, but they aren't that bad. 

**Rating:** 11/13 - Good vibes, lovely singing, definitely made me happy listening to it.



**6. Boy Problems** - This feels like it's even earlier than 80's, it reminds me of Cyndi Lauper. I actually kinda like the lyrics, even if they are so teenager, getting sick of your friends complaining to you about their relationship issues. I'm sad she cut her hair in the music video. :&lt; Other than that the video is pretty safe. I'm not really digging the song that much, it vibes a bit, but the lyrics just don't really relate to me that much, because although I had friends that would complain about their boyfriends, it was never all the time, so I wouldn't really get annoyed. I dunno, seems a bit caddy.

**Rating:** 30/66 - Uninteresting lyrics mixed with an okay arrangement. Not my favorite song.



**7. Making the Most of the Night** - Ooh, loving the drums. Oh I think I've heard Sia's version of this song. I don't really remember it. Ooooh, that vibe in the bridge to the chorus, I am loving it. The chorus is alright, the highlight is Carly's voice obviously. But the best part of this song is easily the verses and bridges just so vibey and I love the buildup. The payoff isn't the best, but I don't really mind with this song. Ooooooh, that third verse though. It's getting me so hyped. I like the little outro too, a nice addition that didn't need to be added but it worked. 

**Rating:** 70/88 - A really fun song with an alright chorus. 



**8. Your Type** - Odd start with the narration in the video. I like the arrangement. Reminds me A LOT of Do What U Want by Lady Gaga. The lyrics aren't bad, the chorus isn't too bad. I'm not really too sure what she's trying to say with the song. I think she's confused which I guess makes sense in a strange way. It's a pretty safe song. The video started off weird, but kind of settled back down in a safe setting. 

**Rating:** 104/186 - Catchy beat, okay lyrically. Safe.



**9. Let's Get Lost** - Haha, fun intro, sounds like a game. Ooooh vibe-y, loving the instruments. CARLY COOING RETURNS! Oooooh fresh beat. Damn this is good. I'm loving everything about this song right now. Chorus is catchy, verses are soothing, beat is amazing. I have to say it again, damn this is good. I'm going to have to listen to E-MO-TION again to see which I prefer. 

**Rating:** 520/510 - Super catchy, fun and amazing beat. Love it.



**10. LA Hallucinations** - Hmmm, interesting intro. Still not sure how to feel 20 seconds in. Pretty decent beat. I'm not quite sure what the song is about. I like the chorus, not too big on the verses. It's meh, not awful, not amazing. It's not really safe either, it just isn't really working for me. Alright song

**Rating:** 8/17 - Odd, sort of catchy. Just alright I guess



**11. Warm Blood** - Oooh whispering. Decent beat. Almost too little is happening right now. Oh I like this chorus though. Catchy. Weird leave from the chorus though with the voice alteration. This song is just kind of really strange. I'm not sure if it's working for me or not. I'm liking the background arrangement a bit more. I'm not actually quite sure what the song is about besides enjoying the feeling of touch from others. I like the whispering, but it's a bit too much here. 

**Rating:** 46/64 - Neat song with a good chorus but takes a few risks that I feel don't work with the song. 



**12. When I Needed You** - Interesting beginning, I'm liking the beat and the drums. Pretty 80's or even earlier. I'm enjoying the hyping up in the verses, the chorus is pretty decent too. It's reminds me of the songs you'd hear at the end of 80's movies, it's kinda cheesy but not in a bad way. I'm digging it, it's definitely decent. It makes me feel really nostalgic. 

**Rating:** 72/90 - Fun, nostalgic, a bit cheesy, but decent and does the job. 



**13. Black Heart** - Oooh chiptune-y. Hmm, I was expecting it to build a bit more, but it's not really. Lyrics are, odd. Singing is good but I don't know if it really fits with the background music. The arrangement is starting to bore me :P. This is still definitely 80's, I just am not a big fan of this part of the 80's music-wise. Meh.

**Rating:** 1068/2222 - Too little for me to stay interested throughout the song. The message is also muddled in the lyrics.



**14. I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance** - Ooh. Sultry. Carly Cooing returns! Good vibe with the arrangement, I'm definitely digging it. OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS CHORUS. Gives me the chills in all the right ways. MMM I'm vibing out right now. Oh god this is doing everything right for me right now. I want to start clapping along. The verses do the right amount of hyping and the choruses work of it perfectly. 

**Rating:** 887/888 - Great vibes, pretty close to pop perfection.



**15. Favourite Colour** - Imogen Heap vibes right off the bat. Pretty chill, I don't mind it. I really like the chorus. The belting works here for me. It seems really honest. More honest than a lot of the songs, I actually like it. Lyrics are earnest. Beat is decent, arrangement is nice. It feels like this is a song of something admitting all their feelings to someone, and the good feelings that can come with that. I like the synth. 

**Rating:** 1345/1390 - Really nice song, something I'd really put on a chill-out mix maybe. Really honest.



**16. Never Get to Hold You** - Oooh, more Carly cooing. Chills. Good vibes. The arrangement is definitely working me up to something. Another song that reminds me of Do What U Want, but I like this one a bit better. Got a good beat and I like the lyrics. They relate to me a lot more, regretting something you said almost immediately after you said it. I really like the vibes in this song. Good arrangement. Just nice.

**Rating:** 71/79 - Warmed me up a bit, really something to vibe out to. Nice song.



**17. Love Again** - Oh, I'm liking the way this is starting. This synth is really catchy. Her voice is amazing in this song. I like the chorus, this really feels like the finale of an album. I love it. I'm jamming out to this song right now. It's not the best song on the album but I am really enjoying it. It makes me wistful and nostalgic about the album I just listened to, and makes me want to listen to it again. 

**Rating:** 99/99.9 - A higher rating than it deserves, but it makes me enjoy the album even more.



Well, that's all of E-MO-TION. Actually a really good album. However, I'm not done yet, I'm going to do Side B too!

**1. First Time** - Oooh, k this is really Cyndi Lauper. ""I don't care"". I'm liking the lyrics, and the beat and arrangement. Pretty jamming, super 80's. Pretty decent bop, fun but a bit forgetful.

**Rating:** - 81/93 - Fun, catchy, good beat. Pinnacle of the 80's



**2. Higher** - Oh k this I like. Another arrangement reminiscent of Do What U Want. I'm liking the chorus. Makes me really feel like she's talking to me. This song just makes me want to look up pictures of Carly smiling. I'm loving the vibe in the verses. I really like the third verse. ""Gets me higher"". I feel like this album would be amazing on drugs. 

**Rating:** 175/205 - Catchy, good solid beat. I enjoyed it. 



**3. The One** - Ok yes. This intro is perfection. Perfect beat. More Carly Cooing! I LOVE the arrangement of this song. Her voice just vibes so well with the production of this song. Pure ecstasy. Jamming really hard right now. I like how this song is giving a much different message than the rest of the songs on both albums. It's very in the moment and ignoring the consequences of her actions which I very much like. Top notch. 

**Rating:** 99/102 - Really close to perfect in every aspect, there's just something that doesn't top the top three songs of E-MO-TION.



**4. Fever** - Another song that I really like the intro of. Another sultry song. This song is super 80's too. I'm vibing with this a lot. Really quite enjoy it. The soft verses and the bombastic chorus complement each other nicely. The lyrics are pretty alright, but I'm not really paying attention to them, I'm jamming to the music. 

**Rating:** 85/90 - Bop!



**5. Body Language** - I'm not really sure what to say, it's pretty entertaining! The arrangement is pretty 80's too. Not a huge fan of how she's pronouncing Body Language. Lyrics are pretty relatable, I'm enjoying the song more as it goes on, I like the background ""Oooooooh"" calls. 

**Rating:** 77/100 - Decent and fun.



**6. Cry** - Ok a sad song. Or not. Definitely lower than the rest of the songs. Ah a song about frustration towards your significant other. It's nice, not really amazing. I'm enjoying the arrangement, but not much beyond that, kind of boring for me. Forgettable

**Rating**: 502/1079 - Good beat, but I really wasn't engaged. 



**7. Store** - I like the softer intro. It's soothing. Carly cooing makes her triumphant return. More 80's vibes. Oh ouch. I do not like that chorus. Sounds really juvenile. Ruined the nice verse. It also just doesn't fit with the rest of the song pretty much at all. I would have really liked this song without that annoying chorus.

**Rating:** 101/257 - Besides the chorus, nice song! Soothing and relaxing



**8. Roses** - Oh another calm song. Carly's cooing finale. I like it so far. Simple yet effective. Oh a nice transition into the chorus. This song makes me feel nice. The arrangement, the lyrics, the beat, and the singing all really works for me. Probably my favorite slower song next to maybe Let's Get Lost. Yes, a good finale to Side B, not as good a finale as Love Again, but pretty good in it's own right.

**Rating:** 8/9 - Made me happy, and I loved pretty much everything about it. 




And that's Side B! 

Overall I can't do a best to worst list for the songs because so many of them are so close, but I can separate them into tiers!

Hey wassup, long time lurker and occasional poster in popheads mainly because I don't have quite the same taste as the majority of the common posters here, so I merely read and enjoy the flamboyancy at times. 

But, as time has gone on, I have come to learn that the fanbase of the queen of hating celery is not to be trifled with, and it's time I judged this so called ""Greatest Album of All Time"" with my own ears and see how I like it compared to what I've heard.

As a little preface I've only heard two songs on the album a few times before: I Really Like You and Run Away With Me. Personally, I hated I Really Like You and loved Run Away With Me, but I will still be critiquing them all the same for all of you to enjoy. And of course, I will use an arbitrary numbering system that means nothing &lt;3



**1. Run Away With Me** - I absolutely adore the saxophone intro, and then the quick and refreshing beat. The lyrics are so whimsical and relatable, I can totally imagine myself wanting to say some of these things to someone I care for. The choruses are so infectious and fun, I always want to sing along whenever I hear it. Great song. The video is also really good as it shows her consistently giving me bedroom eyes, which I very much enjoy. 

**Rating:** 17/15 - Pretty much pop perfection



**2. E-MO-TION** - Ah, the song the album is named after, well, let's hear it. Oooooh, I like the disco-y vibe with the background instruments. Ah a breakup song. I love the beat and the vibe, she doesn't even seem bitter, she just kind of misses him. I'm really digging the chorus. (I might be misinterpreting it, sorry if I am :P) I can totally relate though, still having feelings and not really sure what to do with the emotions that were left behind after the breakup. I really enjoyed this bop. 

**Rating:** 964/1000 - I really enjoy the lyrics and the arrangement. Definitely close to Run Away With Me. 



**3. I Really Like You** - Ah, yes, the dreaded song, let's see if my opinion has changed since the last time. Tom Hanks was an odd choice. I like the drums in the background. The lyrics are sort of relatable, but I lose it in the chorus which seems just so juvenile. I CAN relate, but the word choice is just a bit too cringe for me to enjoy the song. It's fun, it's light, but I wouldn't choose it over the previous two songs by a long shot.

**Rating:** 4/8 - Juvenile, but catchy.



**4. Gimmie Love** - Hmm, softer intro. I really like the first verse. Relatable and wanting what you want and it being hard to control. But I lost it during the chorus, not a big fan of the repeating words constantly in the intro, has the same problem I Really Like You does for me. The arrangement is okay with this one, but I'm not really noticing it that much. Verses good, chorus bad. The ending is pretty good though. I need more Carly cooing and less Carly belting it out.

**Rating:** 53/90 - Not a bad song, but again, something I wouldn't listen to consistently. 



**5. All That** - Ooh, the intro sound very 80's, I'm liking it so far. I like the slowness and the electronic keyboard in the background. This is literally what I just asked for, Carly cooing. I really enjoy the mellow vibe and the soothing tone. This entire song is just working for me right now. Even when she starts belting it out by the end, I feel like she's earned it this time, like she's trying to enforce this point and she's turning a bit desperate. I like it. Lyrics are a bit confusing for me, but they aren't that bad. 

**Rating:** 11/13 - Good vibes, lovely singing, definitely made me happy listening to it.



**6. Boy Problems** - This feels like it's even earlier than 80's, it reminds me of Cyndi Lauper. I actually kinda like the lyrics, even if they are so teenager, getting sick of your friends complaining to you about their relationship issues. I'm sad she cut her hair in the music video. :&lt; Other than that the video is pretty safe. I'm not really digging the song that much, it vibes a bit, but the lyrics just don't really relate to me that much, because although I had friends that would complain about their boyfriends, it was never all the time, so I wouldn't really get annoyed. I dunno, seems a bit caddy.

**Rating:** 30/66 - Uninteresting lyrics mixed with an okay arrangement. Not my favorite song.



**7. Making the Most of the Night** - Ooh, loving the drums. Oh I think I've heard Sia's version of this song. I don't really remember it. Ooooh, that vibe in the bridge to the chorus, I am loving it. The chorus is alright, the highlight is Carly's voice obviously. But the best part of this song is easily the verses and bridges just so vibey and I love the buildup. The payoff isn't the best, but I don't really mind with this song. Ooooooh, that third verse though. It's getting me so hyped. I like the little outro too, a nice addition that didn't need to be added but it worked. 

**Rating:** 70/88 - A really fun song with an alright chorus. 



**8. Your Type** - Odd start with the narration in the video. I like the arrangement. Reminds me A LOT of Do What U Want by Lady Gaga. The lyrics aren't bad, the chorus isn't too bad. I'm not really too sure what she's trying to say with the song. I think she's confused which I guess makes sense in a strange way. It's a pretty safe song. The video started off weird, but kind of settled back down in a safe setting. 

**Rating:** 104/186 - Catchy beat, okay lyrically. Safe.



**9. Let's Get Lost** - Haha, fun intro, sounds like a game. Ooooh vibe-y, loving the instruments. CARLY COOING RETURNS! Oooooh fresh beat. Damn this is good. I'm loving everything about this song right now. Chorus is catchy, verses are soothing, beat is amazing. I have to say it again, damn this is good. I'm going to have to listen to E-MO-TION again to see which I prefer. 

**Rating:** 520/510 - Super catchy, fun and amazing beat. Love it.



**10. LA Hallucinations** - Hmmm, interesting intro. Still not sure how to feel 20 seconds in. Pretty decent beat. I'm not quite sure what the song is about. I like the chorus, not too big on the verses. It's meh, not awful, not amazing. It's not really safe either, it just isn't really working for me. Alright song

**Rating:** 8/17 - Odd, sort of catchy. Just alright I guess



**11. Warm Blood** - Oooh whispering. Decent beat. Almost too little is happening right now. Oh I like this chorus though. Catchy. Weird leave from the chorus though with the voice alteration. This song is just kind of really strange. I'm not sure if it's working for me or not. I'm liking the background arrangement a bit more. I'm not actually quite sure what the song is about besides enjoying the feeling of touch from others. I like the whispering, but it's a bit too much here. 

**Rating:** 46/64 - Neat song with a good chorus but takes a few risks that I feel don't work with the song. 



**12. When I Needed You** - Interesting beginning, I'm liking the beat and the drums. Pretty 80's or even earlier. I'm enjoying the hyping up in the verses, the chorus is pretty decent too. It's reminds me of the songs you'd hear at the end of 80's movies, it's kinda cheesy but not in a bad way. I'm digging it, it's definitely decent. It makes me feel really nostalgic. 

**Rating:** 72/90 - Fun, nostalgic, a bit cheesy, but decent and does the job. 



**13. Black Heart** - Oooh chiptune-y. Hmm, I was expecting it to build a bit more, but it's not really. Lyrics are, odd. Singing is good but I don't know if it really fits with the background music. The arrangement is starting to bore me :P. This is still definitely 80's, I just am not a big fan of this part of the 80's music-wise. Meh.

**Rating:** 1068/2222 - Too little for me to stay interested throughout the song. The message is also muddled in the lyrics.



**14. I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance** - Ooh. Sultry. Carly Cooing returns! Good vibe with the arrangement, I'm definitely digging it. OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS CHORUS. Gives me the chills in all the right ways. MMM I'm vibing out right now. Oh god this is doing everything right for me right now. I want to start clapping along. The verses do the right amount of hyping and the choruses work of it perfectly. 

**Rating:** 887/888 - Great vibes, pretty close to pop perfection.



**15. Favourite Colour** - Imogen Heap vibes right off the bat. Pretty chill, I don't mind it. I really like the chorus. The belting works here for me. It seems really honest. More honest than a lot of the songs, I actually like it. Lyrics are earnest. Beat is decent, arrangement is nice. It feels like this is a song of something admitting all their feelings to someone, and the good feelings that can come with that. I like the synth. 

**Rating:** 1345/1390 - Really nice song, something I'd really put on a chill-out mix maybe. Really honest.



**16. Never Get to Hold You** - Oooh, more Carly cooing. Chills. Good vibes. The arrangement is definitely working me up to something. Another song that reminds me of Do What U Want, but I like this one a bit better. Got a good beat and I like the lyrics. They relate to me a lot more, regretting something you said almost immediately after you said it. I really like the vibes in this song. Good arrangement. Just nice.

**Rating:** 71/79 - Warmed me up a bit, really something to vibe out to. Nice song.



**17. Love Again** - Oh, I'm liking the way this is starting. This synth is really catchy. Her voice is amazing in this song. I like the chorus, this really feels like the finale of an album. I love it. I'm jamming out to this song right now. It's not the best song on the album but I am really enjoying it. It makes me wistful and nostalgic about the album I just listened to, and makes me want to listen to it again. 

**Rating:** 99/99.9 - A higher rating than it deserves, but it makes me enjoy the album even more.



Well, that's all of E-MO-TION. Actually a really good album. However, I'm not done yet, I'm going to do Side B too!

**1. First Time** - Oooh, k this is really Cyndi Lauper. ""I don't care"". I'm liking the lyrics, and the beat and arrangement. Pretty jamming, super 80's. Pretty decent bop, fun but a bit forgetful.

**Rating:** - 81/93 - Fun, catchy, good beat. Pinnacle of the 80's



**2. Higher** - Oh k this I like. Another arrangement reminiscent of Do What U Want. I'm liking the chorus. Makes me really feel like she's talking to me. This song just makes me want to look up pictures of Carly smiling. I'm loving the vibe in the verses. I really like the third verse. ""Gets me higher"". I feel like this album would be amazing on drugs. 

**Rating:** 175/205 - Catchy, good solid beat. I enjoyed it. 



**3. The One** - Ok yes. This intro is perfection. Perfect beat. More Carly Cooing! I LOVE the arrangement of this song. Her voice just vibes so well with the production of this song. Pure ecstasy. Jamming really hard right now. I like how this song is giving a much different message than the rest of the songs on both albums. It's very in the moment and ignoring the consequences of her actions which I very much like. Top notch. 

**Rating:** 99/102 - Really close to perfect in every aspect, there's just something that doesn't top the top three songs of E-MO-TION.



**4. Fever** - Another song that I really like the intro of. Another sultry song. This song is super 80's too. I'm vibing with this a lot. Really quite enjoy it. The soft verses and the bombastic chorus complement each other nicely. The lyrics are pretty alright, but I'm not really paying attention to them, I'm jamming to the music. 

**Rating:** 85/90 - Bop!



**5. Body Language** - I'm not really sure what to say, it's pretty entertaining! The arrangement is pretty 80's too. Not a huge fan of how she's pronouncing Body Language. Lyrics are pretty relatable, I'm enjoying the song more as it goes on, I like the background ""Oooooooh"" calls. 

**Rating:** 77/100 - Decent and fun.



**6. Cry** - Ok a sad song. Or not. Definitely lower than the rest of the songs. Ah a song about frustration towards your significant other. It's nice, not really amazing. I'm enjoying the arrangement, but not much beyond that, kind of boring for me. Forgettable

**Rating**: 502/1079 - Good beat, but I really wasn't engaged. 



**7. Store** - I like the softer intro. It's soothing. Carly cooing makes her triumphant return. More 80's vibes. Oh ouch. I do not like that chorus. Sounds really juvenile. Ruined the nice verse. It also just doesn't fit with the rest of the song pretty much at all. I would have really liked this song without that annoying chorus.

**Rating:** 101/257 - Besides the chorus, nice song! Soothing and relaxing



**8. Roses** - Oh another calm song. Carly's cooing finale. I like it so far. Simple yet effective. Oh a nice transition into the chorus. This song makes me feel nice. The arrangement, the lyrics, the beat, and the singing all really works for me. Probably my favorite slower song next to maybe Let's Get Lost. Yes, a good finale to Side B, not as good a finale as Love Again, but pretty good in it's own right.

**Rating:** 8/9 - Made me happy, and I loved pretty much everything about it. 




And that's Side B!

Overall I actually really liked both of these albums, and although there were a few songs I didn't care for, they were all produced very well and all had something that I liked about them. Really A+ job Carly, you have a new stan! \*Goes back to putting Run Away With Me and Let's Get Lost on repeat\* I don't think I can forgive you for not realizing the perfection that is Making The Most of the Night.

Well, that's all of E-MO-TION. Actually a really good album. However, I'm not done yet, I'm going to do Side B too!

**1. First Time** - Oooh, k this is really Cyndi Lauper. ""I don't care"". I'm liking the lyrics, and the beat and arrangement. Pretty jamming, super 80's. Pretty decent bop, fun but a bit forgetful.

**Rating:** - 81/93 - Fun, catchy, good beat. Pinnacle of the 80's



**2. Higher** - Oh k this I like. Another arrangement reminiscent of Do What U Want. I'm liking the chorus. Makes me really feel like she's talking to me.

I feel like this album would be amazing on drugs. 

**Rating:** 175/205 - Catchy, good solid beat. I enjoyed it. 



**3. The One** - Ok yes. This intro is perfection. Perfect beat. More Carly Cooing! I LOVE the arrangement of this song. Her voice just vibes so well with the production of this song. Pure ecstasy. Jamming really hard right now. I like how this song is giving a much different message than the rest of the songs on both albums. It's very in the moment and ignoring the consequences of her actions which I very much like. Top notch. 

**Rating:** 99/102 - Really close to perfect in every aspect, there's just something that doesn't top the top three songs of E-MO-TION.



**4. Fever** - Another song that I really like the intro of. Another sultry song. This song is super 80's too. I'm vibing with this a lot. Really quite enjoy it. The soft verses and the bombastic chorus complement each other nicely. The lyrics are pretty alright, but I'm not really paying attention to them, I'm jamming to the music. 

**Rating:** 85/90 - Bop!



**5. Body Language** - I'm not really sure what to say, it's pretty entertaining! The arrangement is pretty 80's too. Not a huge fan of how she's pronouncing Body Language. Lyrics are pretty relatable, I'm enjoying the song more as it goes on, I like the background ""Oooooooh"" calls. 

**Rating:** 77/100 - Decent and fun.



**6. Cry** - Ok a sad song. Or not. Definitely lower than the rest of the songs. Ah a song about frustration towards your significant other. It's nice, not really amazing. I'm enjoying the arrangement, but not much beyond that, kind of boring for me. Forgettable

**Rating**: 502/1079 - Good beat, but I really wasn't engaged. 



**7. Store** - I like the softer intro. It's soothing. Carly cooing makes her triumphant return. More 80's vibes. Oh ouch. I do not like that chorus. Sounds really juvenile. Ruined the nice verse. It also just doesn't fit with the rest of the song pretty much at all. I would have really liked this song without that annoying chorus.

**Rating:** 101/257 - Besides the chorus, nice song! Soothing and relaxing



**8. Roses** - Oh another calm song. Carly's cooing finale. I like it so far. Simple yet effective. Oh a nice transition into the chorus. This song makes me feel nice. The arrangement, the lyrics, the beat, and the singing all really works for me. Probably my favorite slower song next to maybe Let's Get Lost. Yes, a good finale to Side B, not as good a finale as Love Again, but pretty good in it's own right.

**Rating:** 8/9 - Made me happy, and I loved pretty much everything about it. 




And that's Side B! 

Overall I can't do a best to worst list for the songs because so many of them are so close, but I can separate them into tiers!

Overall I actually really liked both of these albums, and although there were a few songs I didn't care for, they were all produced very well and all had something that I liked about them. Really A+ job Carly, you have a new stan! \*Goes back to putting Run Away With Me and Let's Get Lost on repeat\* I don't think I can forgive you for not realizing the perfection that is Making The Most of the Night.

Hey wassup, long time lurker and occasional poster in popheads mainly because I don't have quite the same taste as the majority of the common posters here, so I merely read and enjoy the flamboyancy at times. 

But, as time has gone on, I have come to learn that the fanbase of the queen of hating celery is not to be trifled with, and it's time I judged this so called ""Greatest Album of All Time"" with my own ears and see how I like it compared to what I've heard.

As a little preface I've only heard two songs on the album a few times before: I Really Like You and Run Away With Me. Personally, I hated I Really Like You and loved Run Away With Me, but I will still be critiquing them all the same for all of you to enjoy. And of course, I will use an arbitrary numbering system that means nothing &lt;3



**1. Run Away With Me** - I absolutely adore the saxophone intro, and then the quick and refreshing beat. The lyrics are so whimsical and relatable, I can totally imagine myself wanting to say some of these things to someone I care for. The choruses are so infectious and fun, I always want to sing along whenever I hear it. Great song. The video is also really good as it shows her consistently giving me bedroom eyes, which I very much enjoy. 

**Rating:** 17/15 - Pretty much pop perfection



**2. E-MO-TION** - Ah, the song the album is named after, well, let's hear it. Oooooh, I like the disco-y vibe with the background instruments. Ah a breakup song. I love the beat and the vibe, she doesn't even seem bitter, she just kind of misses him. I'm really digging the chorus. (I might be misinterpreting it, sorry if I am :P) I can totally relate though, still having feelings and not really sure what to do with the emotions that were left behind after the breakup. I really enjoyed this bop. 

**Rating:** 964/1000 - I really enjoy the lyrics and the arrangement. Definitely close to Run Away With Me. 



**3. I Really Like You** - Ah, yes, the dreaded song, let's see if my opinion has changed since the last time. Tom Hanks was an odd choice. I like the drums in the background. The lyrics are sort of relatable, but I lose it in the chorus which seems just so juvenile. I CAN relate, but the word choice is just a bit too cringe for me to enjoy the song. It's fun, it's light, but I wouldn't choose it over the previous two songs by a long shot.

**Rating:** 4/8 - Juvenile, but catchy.



**4. Gimmie Love** - Hmm, softer intro. I really like the first verse. Relatable and wanting what you want and it being hard to control. But I lost it during the chorus, not a big fan of the repeating words constantly in the intro, has the same problem I Really Like You does for me. The arrangement is okay with this one, but I'm not really noticing it that much. Verses good, chorus bad. The ending is pretty good though. I need more Carly cooing and less Carly belting it out.

**Rating:** 53/90 - Not a bad song, but again, something I wouldn't listen to consistently. 



**5. All That** - Ooh, the intro sound very 80's, I'm liking it so far. I like the slowness and the electronic keyboard in the background. This is literally what I just asked for, Carly cooing. I really enjoy the mellow vibe and the soothing tone. This entire song is just working for me right now. Even when she starts belting it out by the end, I feel like she's earned it this time, like she's trying to enforce this point and she's turning a bit desperate. I like it. Lyrics are a bit confusing for me, but they aren't that bad. 

**Rating:** 11/13 - Good vibes, lovely singing, definitely made me happy listening to it.



**6. Boy Problems** - This feels like it's even earlier than 80's, it reminds me of Cyndi Lauper. I actually kinda like the lyrics, even if they are so teenager, getting sick of your friends complaining to you about their relationship issues. I'm sad she cut her hair in the music video. :&lt; Other than that the video is pretty safe. I'm not really digging the song that much, it vibes a bit, but the lyrics just don't really relate to me that much, because although I had friends that would complain about their boyfriends, it was never all the time, so I wouldn't really get annoyed. I dunno, seems a bit caddy.

**Rating:** 30/66 - Uninteresting lyrics mixed with an okay arrangement. Not my favorite song.



**7. Making the Most of the Night** - Ooh, loving the drums. Oh I think I've heard Sia's version of this song. I don't really remember it. Ooooh, that vibe in the bridge to the chorus, I am loving it. The chorus is alright, the highlight is Carly's voice obviously. But the best part of this song is easily the verses and bridges just so vibey and I love the buildup. The payoff isn't the best, but I don't really mind with this song. Ooooooh, that third verse though. It's getting me so hyped. I like the little outro too, a nice addition that didn't need to be added but it worked. 

**Rating:** 70/88 - A really fun song with an alright chorus. 



**8. Your Type** - Odd start with the narration in the video. I like the arrangement. Reminds me A LOT of Do What U Want by Lady Gaga. The lyrics aren't bad, the chorus isn't too bad. I'm not really too sure what she's trying to say with the song. I think she's confused which I guess makes sense in a strange way. It's a pretty safe song. The video started off weird, but kind of settled back down in a safe setting. 

**Rating:** 104/186 - Catchy beat, okay lyrically. Safe.



**9. Let's Get Lost** - Haha, fun intro, sounds like a game. Ooooh vibe-y, loving the instruments. CARLY COOING RETURNS! Oooooh fresh beat. Damn this is good. I'm loving everything about this song right now. Chorus is catchy, verses are soothing, beat is amazing. I have to say it again, damn this is good. I'm going to have to listen to E-MO-TION again to see which I prefer. 

**Rating:** 520/510 - Super catchy, fun and amazing beat. Love it.



**10. LA Hallucinations** - Hmmm, interesting intro. Still not sure how to feel 20 seconds in. Pretty decent beat. I'm not quite sure what the song is about. I like the chorus, not too big on the verses. It's meh, not awful, not amazing. It's not really safe either, it just isn't really working for me. Alright song

**Rating:** 8/17 - Odd, sort of catchy. Just alright I guess



**11. Warm Blood** - Oooh whispering. Decent beat. Almost too little is happening right now. Oh I like this chorus though. Catchy. Weird leave from the chorus though with the voice alteration. This song is just kind of really strange. I'm not sure if it's working for me or not. I'm liking the background arrangement a bit more. I'm not actually quite sure what the song is about besides enjoying the feeling of touch from others. I like the whispering, but it's a bit too much here. 

**Rating:** 46/64 - Neat song with a good chorus but takes a few risks that I feel don't work with the song. 



**12. When I Needed You** - Interesting beginning, I'm liking the beat and the drums. Pretty 80's or even earlier. I'm enjoying the hyping up in the verses, the chorus is pretty decent too. It's reminds me of the songs you'd hear at the end of 80's movies, it's kinda cheesy but not in a bad way. I'm digging it, it's definitely decent. It makes me feel really nostalgic. 

**Rating:** 72/90 - Fun, nostalgic, a bit cheesy, but decent and does the job. 



**13. Black Heart** - Oooh chiptune-y. Hmm, I was expecting it to build a bit more, but it's not really. Lyrics are, odd. Singing is good but I don't know if it really fits with the background music. The arrangement is starting to bore me :P. This is still definitely 80's, I just am not a big fan of this part of the 80's music-wise. Meh.

**Rating:** 1068/2222 - Too little for me to stay interested throughout the song. The message is also muddled in the lyrics.



**14. I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance** - Ooh. Sultry. Carly Cooing returns! Good vibe with the arrangement, I'm definitely digging it. OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS CHORUS. Gives me the chills in all the right ways. MMM I'm vibing out right now. Oh god this is doing everything right for me right now. I want to start clapping along. The verses do the right amount of hyping and the choruses work of it perfectly. 

**Rating:** 887/888 - Great vibes, pretty close to pop perfection.



**15. Favourite Colour** - Imogen Heap vibes right off the bat. Pretty chill, I don't mind it. I really like the chorus. The belting works here for me. It seems really honest. More honest than a lot of the songs, I actually like it. Lyrics are earnest. Beat is decent, arrangement is nice. It feels like this is a song of something admitting all their feelings to someone, and the good feelings that can come with that. I like the synth. 

**Rating:** 1345/1390 - Really nice song, something I'd really put on a chill-out mix maybe. Really honest.



**16. Never Get to Hold You** - Oooh, more Carly cooing. Chills. Good vibes. The arrangement is definitely working me up to something. Another song that reminds me of Do What U Want, but I like this one a bit better. Got a good beat and I like the lyrics. They relate to me a lot more, regretting something you said almost immediately after you said it. I really like the vibes in this song. Good arrangement. Just nice.

**Rating:** 71/79 - Warmed me up a bit, really something to vibe out to. Nice song.



**17. Love Again** - Oh, I'm liking the way this is starting. This synth is really catchy. Her voice is amazing in this song. I like the chorus, this really feels like the finale of an album. I love it. I'm jamming out to this song right now. It's not the best song on the album but I am really enjoying it. It makes me wistful and nostalgic about the album I just listened to, and makes me want to listen to it again. 

**Rating:** 99/99.9 - A higher rating than it deserves, but it makes me enjoy the album even more.



Well, that's all of E-MO-TION. Actually a really good album. However, I'm not done yet, I'm going to do Side B too!

**1. First Time** - Oooh, k this is really Cyndi Lauper. ""I don't care"". I'm liking the lyrics, and the beat and arrangement. Pretty jamming, super 80's. Pretty decent bop, fun but a bit forgetful.

**Rating:** - 81/93 - Fun, catchy, good beat. Pinnacle of the 80's



**2. Higher** - Oh k this I like. Another arrangement reminiscent of Do What U Want. I'm liking the chorus. Makes me really feel like she's talking to me. This song just makes me want to look up pictures of Carly smiling. I'm loving the vibe in the verses. I really like the third verse. ""Gets me higher"". I feel like this album would be amazing on drugs. 

**Rating:** 175/205 - Catchy, good solid beat. I enjoyed it. 



**3. The One** - Ok yes. This intro is perfection. Perfect beat. More Carly Cooing! I LOVE the arrangement of this song. Her voice just vibes so well with the production of this song. Pure ecstasy. Jamming really hard right now. I like how this song is giving a much different message than the rest of the songs on both albums. It's very in the moment and ignoring the consequences of her actions which I very much like. Top notch. 

**Rating:** 99/102 - Really close to perfect in every aspect, there's just something that doesn't top the top three songs of E-MO-TION.



**4. Fever** - Another song that I really like the intro of. Another sultry song. This song is super 80's too. I'm vibing with this a lot. Really quite enjoy it. The soft verses and the bombastic chorus complement each other nicely. The lyrics are pretty alright, but I'm not really paying attention to them, I'm jamming to the music. 

**Rating:** 85/90 - Bop!



**5. Body Language** - I'm not really sure what to say, it's pretty entertaining! The arrangement is pretty 80's too. Not a huge fan of how she's pronouncing Body Language. Lyrics are pretty relatable, I'm enjoying the song more as it goes on, I like the background ""Oooooooh"" calls. 

**Rating:** 77/100 - Decent and fun.



**6. Cry** - Ok a sad song. Or not. Definitely lower than the rest of the songs. Ah a song about frustration towards your significant other. It's nice, not really amazing. I'm enjoying the arrangement, but not much beyond that, kind of boring for me. Forgettable

**Rating**: 502/1079 - Good beat, but I really wasn't engaged. 



**7. Store** - I like the softer intro. It's soothing. Carly cooing makes her triumphant return. More 80's vibes. Oh ouch. I do not like that chorus. Sounds really juvenile. Ruined the nice verse. It also just doesn't fit with the rest of the song pretty much at all. I would have really liked this song without that annoying chorus.

**Rating:** 101/257 - Besides the chorus, nice song! Soothing and relaxing



**8. Roses** - Oh another calm song. Carly's cooing finale. I like it so far. Simple yet effective. Oh a nice transition into the chorus. This song makes me feel nice. The arrangement, the lyrics, the beat, and the singing all really works for me. Probably my favorite slower song next to maybe Let's Get Lost. Yes, a good finale to Side B, not as good a finale as Love Again, but pretty good in it's own right.

**Rating:** 8/9 - Made me happy, and I loved pretty much everything about it. 




And that's Side B!

I'm not really too sure what she's trying to say with the song. I think she's confused which I guess makes sense in a strange way. It's a pretty safe song. The video started off weird, but kind of settled back down in a safe setting. 

**Rating:** 104/186 - Catchy beat, okay lyrically. Safe.



**9. Let's Get Lost** - Haha, fun intro, sounds like a game. Ooooh vibe-y, loving the instruments. CARLY COOING RETURNS! Oooooh fresh beat. Damn this is good. I'm loving everything about this song right now. Chorus is catchy, verses are soothing, beat is amazing. I have to say it again, damn this is good. I'm going to have to listen to E-MO-TION again to see which I prefer. 

**Rating:** 520/510 - Super catchy, fun and amazing beat. Love it.



**10. LA Hallucinations** - Hmmm, interesting intro. Still not sure how to feel 20 seconds in. Pretty decent beat. I'm not quite sure what the song is about. I like the chorus, not too big on the verses. It's meh, not awful, not amazing. It's not really safe either, it just isn't really working for me. Alright song

**Rating:** 8/17 - Odd, sort of catchy. Just alright I guess



**11. Warm Blood** - Oooh whispering. Decent beat. Almost too little is happening right now. Oh I like this chorus though. Catchy. Weird leave from the chorus though with the voice alteration. This song is just kind of really strange. I'm not sure if it's working for me or not. I'm liking the background arrangement a bit more. I'm not actually quite sure what the song is about besides enjoying the feeling of touch from others. I like the whispering, but it's a bit too much here. 

**Rating:** 46/64 - Neat song with a good chorus but takes a few risks that I feel don't work with the song. 



**12. When I Needed You** - Interesting beginning, I'm liking the beat and the drums. Pretty 80's or even earlier. I'm enjoying the hyping up in the verses, the chorus is pretty decent too. It's reminds me of the songs you'd hear at the end of 80's movies, it's kinda cheesy but not in a bad way. I'm digging it, it's definitely decent. It makes me feel really nostalgic. 

**Rating:** 72/90 - Fun, nostalgic, a bit cheesy, but decent and does the job. 



**13. Black Heart** - Oooh chiptune-y. Hmm, I was expecting it to build a bit more, but it's not really. Lyrics are, odd. Singing is good but I don't know if it really fits with the background music. The arrangement is starting to bore me :P. This is still definitely 80's, I just am not a big fan of this part of the 80's music-wise. Meh.

**Rating:** 1068/2222 - Too little for me to stay interested throughout the song. The message is also muddled in the lyrics.



**14. I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance** - Ooh. Sultry. Carly Cooing returns! Good vibe with the arrangement, I'm definitely digging it. OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS CHORUS. Gives me the chills in all the right ways. MMM I'm vibing out right now. Oh god this is doing everything right for me right now. I want to start clapping along. The verses do the right amount of hyping and the choruses work of it perfectly. 

**Rating:** 887/888 - Great vibes, pretty close to pop perfection.



**15. Favourite Colour** - Imogen Heap vibes right off the bat. Pretty chill, I don't mind it. I really like the chorus. The belting works here for me. It seems really honest. More honest than a lot of the songs, I actually like it. Lyrics are earnest. Beat is decent, arrangement is nice. It feels like this is a song of something admitting all their feelings to someone, and the good feelings that can come with that. I like the synth. 

**Rating:** 1345/1390 - Really nice song, something I'd really put on a chill-out mix maybe. Really honest.



**16. Never Get to Hold You** - Oooh, more Carly cooing. Chills. Good vibes. The arrangement is definitely working me up to something. Another song that reminds me of Do What U Want, but I like this one a bit better. Got a good beat and I like the lyrics. They relate to me a lot more, regretting something you said almost immediately after you said it. I really like the vibes in this song. Good arrangement. Just nice.

**Rating:** 71/79 - Warmed me up a bit, really something to vibe out to. Nice song.



**17. Love Again** - Oh, I'm liking the way this is starting. This synth is really catchy. Her voice is amazing in this song. I like the chorus, this really feels like the finale of an album. I love it. I'm jamming out to this song right now. It's not the best song on the album but I am really enjoying it. It makes me wistful and nostalgic about the album I just listened to, and makes me want to listen to it again. 

**Rating:** 99/99.9 - A higher rating than it deserves, but it makes me enjoy the album even more.



Well, that's all of E-MO-TION. Actually a really good album. However, I'm not done yet, I'm going to do Side B too!

**1. First Time** - Oooh, k this is really Cyndi Lauper. ""I don't care"". I'm liking the lyrics, and the beat and arrangement. Pretty jamming, super 80's. Pretty decent bop, fun but a bit forgetful.

**Rating:** - 81/93 - Fun, catchy, good beat. Pinnacle of the 80's



**2. Higher** - Oh k this I like. Another arrangement reminiscent of Do What U Want. I'm liking the chorus. Makes me really feel like she's talking to me. This song just makes me want to look up pictures of Carly smiling. I'm loving the vibe in the verses. I really like the third verse. ""Gets me higher"". I feel like this album would be amazing on drugs. 

**Rating:** 175/205 - Catchy, good solid beat. I enjoyed it. 



**3. The One** - Ok yes. This intro is perfection. Perfect beat. More Carly Cooing! I LOVE the arrangement of this song. Her voice just vibes so well with the production of this song. Pure ecstasy. Jamming really hard right now. I like how this song is giving a much different message than the rest of the songs on both albums. It's very in the moment and ignoring the consequences of her actions which I very much like. Top notch. 

**Rating:** 99/102 - Really close to perfect in every aspect, there's just something that doesn't top the top three songs of E-MO-TION.



**4. Fever** - Another song that I really like the intro of. Another sultry song. This song is super 80's too. I'm vibing with this a lot. Really quite enjoy it. The soft verses and the bombastic chorus complement each other nicely. The lyrics are pretty alright, but I'm not really paying attention to them, I'm jamming to the music. 

**Rating:** 85/90 - Bop!



**5. Body Language** - I'm not really sure what to say, it's pretty entertaining! The arrangement is pretty 80's too. Not a huge fan of how she's pronouncing Body Language. Lyrics are pretty relatable, I'm enjoying the song more as it goes on, I like the background ""Oooooooh"" calls. 

**Rating:** 77/100 - Decent and fun.



**6. Cry** - Ok a sad song. Or not. Definitely lower than the rest of the songs. Ah a song about frustration towards your significant other. It's nice, not really amazing. I'm enjoying the arrangement, but not much beyond that, kind of boring for me. Forgettable

**Rating**: 502/1079 - Good beat, but I really wasn't engaged. 



**7. Store** - I like the softer intro. It's soothing. Carly cooing makes her triumphant return. More 80's vibes. Oh ouch. I do not like that chorus. Sounds really juvenile. Ruined the nice verse. It also just doesn't fit with the rest of the song pretty much at all. I would have really liked this song without that annoying chorus.

**Rating:** 101/257 - Besides the chorus, nice song! Soothing and relaxing



**8. Roses** - Oh another calm song. Carly's cooing finale. I like it so far. Simple yet effective. Oh a nice transition into the chorus. This song makes me feel nice. The arrangement, the lyrics, the beat, and the singing all really works for me. Probably my favorite slower song next to maybe Let's Get Lost. Yes, a good finale to Side B, not as good a finale as Love Again, but pretty good in it's own right.

**Rating:** 8/9 - Made me happy, and I loved pretty much everything about it. 




And that's Side B!

Shamelessly inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/58dzht/discussion_what_is_your_favorite_intro_track_to/).

It came into my mind that an outro might just be more impactful than an intro because of how it combines newer elements introduced as the album went on, even if the intros are more discussed.

M83's Hurry Up We're Dreaming (my favorite album) has an [Outro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbm8zdA-MMc) famous for how it has been combined [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ky0avfevdY) [movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWnAqFyaQ5s#t=3m15s), and rightfully so. It reflects the theme of dreams found across the album in a conclusive manner. Furthermore, Kendrick Lamar's [Mortal Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-bakGq-_zk) is an amazing, incredibly well known outro partially because of its Tupac interview. It's clearly the end of the album, but it leaves you thinking because the interview has a long-lasting purpose in the context of the album.

In short, a good outro draws from the rest of the album to leave a lasting final impression on the listener. What are your favorites? *Rise* by Selena Gomez.

I like an album when the last track is neither a ballad nor a midtempo song, which sadly I heard way too much in many albums these days. In that case, *Revival* nailed it with this powerful ending.",Outro,M83,66.6666666666666,80.0,"['combines newer elements introduced as the album went on', 'leaves you thinking', 'powerful ending']","[""M83's Outro is famous for its combination with movies"", ""Mortal Man's Tupac interview gives it a long-lasting purpose""]",['end of the album'],"['reflects the theme of dreams', 'leaves a lasting final impression']",,[],"[['Outro', 'M83'], ['Mortal Man', 'Kendrick Lamar'], ['Rise', 'Selena Gomez']]",A powerful ending that leaves you thinking.

Now y'all, I was in your camp. I thought she was talentless and somewhat crude. After I listened to this album, though? I'll let my flair do all the talking (or what do giraffes do? Neigh? Whinny? Moo?)

1. The Best Part- It's a short introduction to her piece, and I know y'all are thinking that this is the best part since it's short and it's at the start, so you can quit and not feel guilty. However, this classy 60's inspired bop will leave you gagging for more. (4/5)

2. All About That Bass- If The Best Part was white, this is Meghan's appeal to be inclusive to all races and ethnicities. Here's the thing- MTrain has a big booty, and she's gonna wave it all around. This is trashy, vulgar, and crude... But I have to give her credit for trying to fit in with the ""urban"" scene, as she refers it. (3.5/5)

3. Dear Future Husband- Meghan is a riddle and an enigma. This is an anti-feminist anthem that's set in the 60s. Is it cute? Yes. Is it classy? No. Did she learn how to cook? No. Can she write a hook? HELL YES. (4/5)

4. Close Your Eyes- Thank god, I did just that and went to sleep listening to this. (0.5/5)

5. 3am- YAS, MTRAIN WOKE UP! She closed her eyes and woke up to text someone at 3am! Too bad it's probably a takeout order, but you know what? She has a Grammy, and you don't. She can do what she pleases. (4.5/5)

6. Like I'm Gonna Lose You- Meghan played it smart here once again. As a white woman with a big booty, she's scared to be misaligned in the media. What does she do? Sing with John Legend and get some diversity in here! This modern-day Ebony and Ivory was a hit, and it'll go down as one of the biggest moments in cross-racial history. (4.5/5)

7. Bang Dem Sticks- Meghan shows the world that she is a lyrical genius. Here's Exhibit A:

&gt; The dumb drummer,
Sicker than the swine flu/Don't really need medication/He gotta tissue, uh/And when he bang bangs don't need to boogie but/He might be sweeter than my, my favorite cookie.

That's a hard thing to accomplish. Meghan Trainor loves her cookies, so being that sweet is a victory. Here's Exhibit B:

&gt; Triplet triplet, all dat shit/He looking so good when he bang dem sticks/He could do the paradiddle/With a little bit of samba/And all the girls scream ""I want yo drummer's numba!""/But wait a minute? What the **fuck** is going on?

Ooh, Meghan is angry! She is not having it tonight!!! (4/5)

\#8. Walkashame- With a lyric like ""Daddy knows I'm a good girl"", it's got to be a treasure. (4.5/5)

\#9. Title- WHAT KIND OF META SHIT IS THIS?! SHE NAMEDROPS 3AM WITHIN THE SONG, and she talks about being naked and she swears, so that's another point in the ""urban/hood"" demographic! (5/5)

\#10. What If I- What if you stop right here? (0/5)

\#11. Lips Are Moving- She's going meta again namedropping the beatbopping All About That Bass. It's a pure hit, and it's a homerun for Meghan Trainor! (5/5)

\#12. No Good For You- This song is no good for me, sorry Meghan :( (1/5)

\#13. Mr. Almost- Heyyyyy, Meghan decided to add a rapper to her album so that she can get some street cred! Word! This is a (mr.) Almost perfect piece! Yooo! (4.5/5)

\#14. My Selfish Heart- This is purely heartbreaking. Screw the Titanic. Who cares about Marley and Me? Sarah McLachlan where? (4/5)

\#15. Credit- A sentimental piece about her man leaving her to go to another woman. He's a nice man, he ""doesn't stare at others' boobies"", but you gotta give credit where it's due... and honey, this is a SLAM DUNK. a TOUCHDOWN. a TRIPLE AXLE. (5/5)

\#16. Better When I'm Dancing- To round this off, BWID is an anthem about dancing that was featured in the Charlie Brown movie a few months ago. That shit was phenomenal, and I just have one thing to say.. Do you think Meghan can do the Cha Cha Slide? Can she do the Charlie Brown? Can she push down that floor and shoulder roll (shoulder roll?) Because she can't touch her toes. Anyways, a cute bop (5/5)

Overall... 4/5. Get off your ass and listen to Title. There's a reason Queen Meghan beat Courtney Barnett and Tori Kelly for the Grammy. You'll think I'm crazy, but when you're whipping your neck to Better When I'm Dancing, you'll thank me. You will.
 I have seen a lot of offensive shit on Reddit and sometimes in this sub but you take the cake. Your review is grossly insensitive and disgusting in the way it refers to minorities.

Now to give a full view on why people like it, it's the same reason how 7 Years ascended and appreciated, it was first an alternative song that went straight to the pop category in iTunes due to strong support and reception. Song is also pretty popular for the ever angsty/emotional teenagers, the fact that gnash look likes an alternative G-Eazy and has that twenty one pilots aesthetic (lowercase letters, heavy emphasis on lyrics, rap/sung style) makes it more appealing to teens, mellow pop fans, and tumblr users. Olivia O'Brien does have the voice to give this song some emotional feel. Compared to most pop/indie pop ballads, this song starts with the featuring artist and the main artist performs it in rap form, so I guess that's how people like it, something different, and tbh some of the lyrics does hit hard (""Always missing people that you shouldn't be missing"", for example). It's also fall, the right season for these type of songs to be played.

It's been her most successful single to date and sounds ""bigger"" and more distinctive in terms of production than Break Free...actually listening to Problem now, it's kinda messy, isn't it? lmao. Also I'm not sure how the general public would respond to Greedy (I can't really picture it being a big hit tbh), but I feel like it has a certain timelessness about it.

I agree with you about Break Free btw, it sounds like a quintessential gay anthem and I think that'll definitely contribute to its longevity.",Break Free,Ariana Grande,77.7777777777777,71.4285714285714,"['""bigger"" and more distinctive production of Problem', 'messy sound of Problem', 'quintessential gay anthem sound of Break Free']","[""Britney Spears' early days, NSYNC, and Backstreet Boys are anthems for a throwback party"", 'Break Free as a quintessential gay anthem contributing to its longevity']",['throwback party'],['timelessness of Greedy'],,"[""Problem is Ariana's most successful single to date""]","[['Problem', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Break Free', 'Ariana Grande'], ['Greedy', 'Ariana Grande']]",It sounds like a quintessential gay anthem.

I love the feel-good music on this album. It has what I want and what I need. Instead of being an ""Unorthodox Jukebox,"" I can really hear the simple plot of his 24K Magic Movie: begins with a party, looks for a girl, attracts the girl (""there's that smile I'm looking for""), seduces the girl, spends the night with the girl, and at the end pleads for her to stay because what they got is ""too good to say goodbye"".

There are definitely so many synthesizers and I look forward to hearing the live versions of the song. To be honest, I like Bruno's SNL performance of ""Chunky"" more than the studio version.

The music Bruno Mars is bringing back is amazing and I believe these songs are all going to be played on the radio. I wonder if he purposely had nine tracks so he could break a record of having every track on a top music chart. Like his second album, I'm sad about the length of this--it's just over half an hour for a full listen.

The unnecessary profanity and his expectations of women are definitely negatives, but I guess it's not as bad as the other pop music messages from the past and today. Still, that's not an excuse for Bruno to keep his persona.

Nevertheless, these songs have definitely set the standard and I like that the album is coherent in a way. It's not random, like going from ""Gorilla"" to ""Treasure or from ""Show Me"" to ""Money Make Her Smile"". I do kind of miss songs similar to ""If I Knew"", ""Nothin' on You"", ""Somewhere in Brooklyn"", etc., but I'm glad he has such a variety of songs to sing.

I give this album a solid A and will keep it on repeat for the next months to come.

So let's get a discussion going: what are your favourite songs from your childhood/adolescence that have held over really well? For me there's only really one answer: Justin Timberlake's 'Cry Me A River'.

First off, stellar production from Timbaland. I love Justin's vocal performance, and his background melodies. The keyboards, synths, beatboxing, and vocal layering is absolutely mesmerising.

I remember specifically asking for that song at a school dance I went to: I boogied for a good few minutes. No shame. I was always the weird kid.

I knew that she was someone who deserves to have WAY more than she actually has. 

At this point, I truly believe that she is my favorite artist. All of her music is flawless. I don't think I can find a better discography than hers. That is a really huge compliment, but after sitting down and truly thinking through all of her mixtapes and album... I can firmly stand by that.

She can SING. She has one of the best voices out there right now. Every time she lets out a long high note... it's like I am sent into HEAVEN. She is an angel sent down to bless us. If the only songs you have heard by Tinashe are 2 On or Superlove... you have been missing OUT!

You need to look up ""Bated Breath"" (not that tragic music video tbh) or ""Ghetto Boy"" or ""I Tried"" or basically any of her songs that show off her actual singing ability. 

Yet, even on the other side of things... she can really shoot OUT a banger. All Hands On Deck should have smashed and no one can tell me otherwise. There is no way that song isn't a massive hit waiting to happen. She can release any kind of song and it will just sound amazing!

Ugh... she can also dance and she is just so damn sexy. She really just oozes sex appeal and that is sometimes good enough for some of you. So she really brings everything to the table, but everyone ignores her. She is literally perfection.

She can do no wrong and all of you need to repent. She is the second coming of Carly Rae Jepsen. You all might doubt that, but she is going to blow you all away one day and you will be ASHAMED that you ignored her for so long.

**Background**

1976 was a pretty great year in American history. Viking 1 became the first spacecraft to land on Mars. The nation had a huge party for 200 years in existence. The first *Rocky* movie was released, and The Philadelphia Art Museum steps became a cultural icon. The Cowboys lost the Superbowl, something that we can all get behind. For Fleetwood Mac, a band that was now just as much American as it was British, 1976 left a lot to be desired, and that's putting it lightly. The preceding year had seen the release of their self-titled album, which enjoyed a lot of critical and commercial success. The songs Rhiannon and Landslide are still popular today, which can be attributed to Nick's flawless vocal delivery and great instrumentation and harmonies from the rest of the band.

However, after extensive touring, tensions rose between each and every member of the band. Bassist John McVie and keyboardist/vocalist Christine McVie, who had been married six years, divorced due to tensions directly from touring and Christine's affair with the band's sound engineer. Mick Fleetwood, the band's drummer and along with John one of the two founding members left in the band, found out his wife had an affair with the band's guitarist Bob Weston. Weston was fired shortly afterward. Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks had the most volatile situation of them all; their on/off relationship resulted in frequent shouting matches and was not the relationship you wanted for two of your principle songwriters. Nicks would reveal in [an interview with Uncut in 2003](http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/fleetwood-mac-everybody-was-pretty-weirded-out-the-story-of-rumours-26395) that they were already having troubles prior to joining the band in '74.

The band entered the recording studio with these conflicts weighing heavily on them, along with the press spreading rumors (heh) to the public: Buckingham and Nicks were photographed with their child (except that it was Fleetwood's daughter they were with), Christine McVie was seriously ill in the hospital (untrue), there was a reunion coming up with former members (also untrue). The pressure got to the band members, and they attempted to fix them with an unending flow of alcohol, cocaine, and probably some other things. Since their recording studio was right outside San Francisco, the hippie movement had made sure these substances were readily available. As they began recording, Nicks and Buckingham's shouting matches in between takes were contrasted by the McVie's cold distance and refusal to communicate other than when necessary. Christine had started seeing the band's lighting director, and John responded with an indulgence in drugs and groupies.

Fleetwood took up a guiding role in the group, and was focused on keeping the band together and recording despite his own troubles. He removed the clocks from the studio so the band would keep recording through long hours. As Christ Stone, owner of the recording studio, recalled, ""The band would come in at 7 at night, have a big feast, party till 1 or 2 in the morning, and then when they were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording."" Many of the band members would discuss their issues with Fleetwood, and he would provide friendly advice. Nicks and Christine found a close friendship, and confided in each other about their failing relationships. John and Buckingham had a much more confrontational relationship, and butted heads over their professional and personal lives, while holding a mutual respect for each others' musicianship.

Keeping these issues in mind, *Rumours* becomes a powerfully emotional record. One band member would write a song about another band member, which they both would have to sing on! Nicks, Buckingham, and the former Mrs. McVie would write songs for each other, while John would play bass in quiet frustration. Each song tackles the difficulties of relationships and breakups, something that the five members of Fleetwood Mac had more experience with than probably the combined rest of the world's populace. This exposition is vital to understanding the turmoil presented in the album. With that, let's take a look at the music in *Rumours*. 
***
**Review**

The lyrical and musical themes are fastballed to you with the opener, Second Hand News, and each is used to brilliant effect. Buckingham's lyrics paint a picture of how jaded he is now that his lover (the girl he's **singing along with**) has moved on. *Rumours* is an album of dichotomy; here the one presented is an upbeat, fun song, while the narrator wallows in self-pity and fails miserably at pretending he's past his ex. At the same time, he wouldn't sing the full lyrics in the early takes so as not to upset Nicks. ""I ain't gonna miss you when you go""? [Yeah sure Lindsey](http://i.imgur.com/seh6p.gif). 

Dreams, the second song, has often been described as a look into Stevie Nicks's diary, and there doesn't seem to be a better way to talk about it. Written in an afternoon by Nicks when she wasn't needed for rehearsal, the lyrics are brimming with cheesy first-take lyrics that for whatever reason sound perfect. ""Thunder only happens when it's raining"", she cries in the chorus despite that being obviously untrue. But, this is someone expressing their deepest emotions, so who are we to tell them it's wrong? ""Players only love you when they're playing"" reads bad, but it's a double entendre; there's the obvious meaning, but when you remember this song is about a guy who plays instruments for a living, it becomes a little clearer that Nicks feels seen as valuable for her abilities, but not for herself. Little touches in the production elevate this song to grander levels. When you notice things like the light mmmm that Nicks hums at the very beginning, along with the bass drum getting a little louder at the word ""heartbeat"" to emulate that sound, it's clear that the band spent a lot of time making sure this song was perfect.

We then transition to Never Going Back Again, which might be my favorite song on the album, despite it being sandwiched amongst much more ambitious music on the A-side. From a technical standpoint, the fingerpicked guitar is superb, and serves as the driving force for the track due to the lack of percussion. Luckily that and the electric guitar provide more than enough instrumentation to keep you hooked, while Buckingham's frantic shouting in the chorus reveals a man who is hurt and angry. He resigns with ""I'm never going back again"", followed by an ooooohh that is sublime. Clocking in at only two minutes, I can't tell if the song is too short, or the perfect length to be played over and over again.

Don't Stop is the album's most explosive track; its chorus begs you to scream the words at the slow cars in the right lane as you pass by in your friend's '98 Toyota that you two thought would be a good idea to take a cross-country trip in until it breaks down about 7 hours in. The piano is the centerpiece of the song, as McVie furiously pounds the keys and harmonizes with Buckingham. The two are so in sync that you didn't even notice that Buckingham sings the first verse and Christine sings the second until you sat down to write this review. Following this is Go Your Own Way, which with its predecessor provide one of the gnarliest 1-2 punches of the 70's. Every band member, every instrument, gets a spotlight on this song. John McVie's bass is subtle but integral for the chorus to be funky. The acoustic guitar plays the same chords for three and a half minutes, establishing a baseline that allows the electric guitar to morph and evolve as the song moves along, culminating into one of the only guitar solos on the album and a grand crescendo, assisted by shouts of ""You can go your own way!"". My favorite aspect is Fleetwood's drumming, which gets a little bit more intricate for some incredible results, especially in the verses. And we haven't even talked about the lyrics, which are standard affair for this album by now but, once again, superbly delivered by Buckingham, who at this point has established his vocal style as a force to be reckoned with. Notice small things, like the second verse getting an extension to build tension before the chorus; there's good reason this song is still a hit almost four decades later.

At the conclusion of the first half, Christine McVie slows things in what is by far the most ballady song.  That's probably because Songbird directed at someone who isn't her ex-husband. Instead, she now looks forward to the new love she has found. This might be the one misstep of the album; the song itself is fine, but its placement is a huge comedown after the excitement of the first five songs. Luckily, The Chain picks things right back up. The bass kicks in and you feel like you're in an episode of ice road truckers, with the elements being your greatest enemy. Nicks and Buckingham continue to be perfectly in sync, ironically due to their mutual feelings of frustration and anger. This is the only song written by all five members of the band, and it's clear that all of them feel this way about someone. The song eventually turns into a loud jam sesh, as Fleetwood Mac's members are more than happy to let their instruments express what they can't, don't want to, or what won't be understood in their words. Members of the group have been quoted as not realizing when they were being talked about in another member's lyrics until after the album was released - sometimes it comes down to the music itself to do the talking.

Christine is clearly happy with her new partner, as we've seen both optimistic songs on the album from her. Obviously You Make Loving Fun is a shot at her former spouse, as this new relationship is a direct contrast to the feelings of imprisonment that come with being married to an angry drunk. The two relationships stand in stark contrast, and are thrown in John's face, who of course has a spotlight role in the song with his great bass lines. Keep an ear out for subtle wind chimes in the chorus, just another little detail that shows how meticulously crafted this album is.

I Don't Want to Know is my personal favorite track on the B-side. It's the only song on the album that was written prior to Buckingham and Nicks joining the band, and because of that, it's a lot more upbeat and flat-out fun. The repetition of the verse and chorus, with the bridge occasionally thrown in, lets the words of the two former lovers change with each echo. It's one of the band's most danceable songs; the handclaps and acoustic guitar take you to a backyard on a warm summer night, as you and your friends groove and fail miserably to sing along to a song you all only kind of know. Maybe he'll play Wonderwall next.

We're coming in towards the end, and to celebrate we get Oh Daddy, another ballad from Christine. This might be the only song that isn't directed at a romantic partner! Instead, it's directed at Fleetwood, who was often called the dad of the group due to his leadership and mature presence. Lyrically, however, the titular words are awkward to sing (though in 2016 I guess this counts as a meme), making this potentially the only non-hit of the album. Musically, it's great, and the backing vocals that repeat Christine's choruses are wonderful. 

The thrilling conclusion to this seminal album starts as anything but a thrill, preferring to take its time and feel out exactly what it wants to be. Here, in Gold Dust Woman, we end with Nicks battling over not only her love life, but her addiction to drugs, something that has clearly characterized her until this point. ""Rock on, gold dust woman"" definitely has some entendre behind it. The production, however, is the star of the show, creating a sense of foreboding and anxiety in the hollowness of the hushed instrumentation. The reverb on Nick's voice makes it sound like she's in a room alone, singing as her voice echoes back to her.

**Background**

1976 was a pretty great year in American history. Viking 1 became the first spacecraft to land on Mars. The nation had a huge party for 200 years in existence. The first *Rocky* movie was released, and The Philadelphia Art Museum steps became a cultural icon. The Cowboys lost the Superbowl, something that we can all get behind. For Fleetwood Mac, a band that was now just as much American as it was British, 1976 left a lot to be desired, and that's putting it lightly. The preceding year had seen the release of their self-titled album, which enjoyed a lot of critical and commercial success. The songs Rhiannon and Landslide are still popular today, which can be attributed to Nick's flawless vocal delivery and great instrumentation and harmonies from the rest of the band.

However, after extensive touring, tensions rose between each and every member of the band. Bassist John McVie and keyboardist/vocalist Christine McVie, who had been married six years, divorced due to tensions directly from touring and Christine's affair with the band's sound engineer. Mick Fleetwood, the band's drummer and along with John one of the two founding members left in the band, found out his wife had an affair with the band's guitarist Bob Weston. Weston was fired shortly afterward. Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks had the most volatile situation of them all; their on/off relationship resulted in frequent shouting matches and was not the relationship you wanted for two of your principle songwriters. Nicks would reveal in [an interview with Uncut in 2003](http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/fleetwood-mac-everybody-was-pretty-weirded-out-the-story-of-rumours-26395) that they were already having troubles prior to joining the band in '74.

The band entered the recording studio with these conflicts weighing heavily on them, along with the press spreading rumors (heh) to the public: Buckingham and Nicks were photographed with their child (except that it was Fleetwood's daughter they were with), Christine McVie was seriously ill in the hospital (untrue), there was a reunion coming up with former members (also untrue). The pressure got to the band members, and they attempted to fix them with an unending flow of alcohol, cocaine, and probably some other things. Since their recording studio was right outside San Francisco, the hippie movement had made sure these substances were readily available. As they began recording, Nicks and Buckingham's shouting matches in between takes were contrasted by the McVie's cold distance and refusal to communicate other than when necessary. Christine had started seeing the band's lighting director, and John responded with an indulgence in drugs and groupies.

Fleetwood took up a guiding role in the group, and was focused on keeping the band together and recording despite his own troubles. He removed the clocks from the studio so the band would keep recording through long hours. As Christ Stone, owner of the recording studio, recalled, ""The band would come in at 7 at night, have a big feast, party till 1 or 2 in the morning, and then when they were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording."" Many of the band members would discuss their issues with Fleetwood, and he would provide friendly advice. Nicks and Christine found a close friendship, and confided in each other about their failing relationships. John and Buckingham had a much more confrontational relationship, and butted heads over their professional and personal lives, while holding a mutual respect for each others' musicianship.

Keeping these issues in mind, *Rumours* becomes a powerfully emotional record. One band member would write a song about another band member, which they both would have to sing on! Nicks, Buckingham, and the former Mrs. McVie would write songs for each other, while John would play bass in quiet frustration. Each song tackles the difficulties of relationships and breakups, something that the five members of Fleetwood Mac had more experience with than probably the combined rest of the world's populace. This exposition is vital to understanding the turmoil presented in the album. With that, let's take a look at the music in *Rumours*. 
***
**Review**

The lyrical and musical themes are fastballed to you with the opener, Second Hand News, and each is used to brilliant effect. Buckingham's lyrics paint a picture of how jaded he is now that his lover (the girl he's **singing along with**) has moved on. *Rumours* is an album of dichotomy; here the one presented is an upbeat, fun song, while the narrator wallows in self-pity and fails miserably at pretending he's past his ex. At the same time, he wouldn't sing the full lyrics in the early takes so as not to upset Nicks. ""I ain't gonna miss you when you go""? [Yeah sure Lindsey](http://i.imgur.com/seh6p.gif). 

Dreams, the second song, has often been described as a look into Stevie Nicks's diary, and there doesn't seem to be a better way to talk about it. Written in an afternoon by Nicks when she wasn't needed for rehearsal, the lyrics are brimming with cheesy first-take lyrics that for whatever reason sound perfect. ""Thunder only happens when it's raining"", she cries in the chorus despite that being obviously untrue. But, this is someone expressing their deepest emotions, so who are we to tell them it's wrong? ""Players only love you when they're playing"" reads bad, but it's a double entendre; there's the obvious meaning, but when you remember this song is about a guy who plays instruments for a living, it becomes a little clearer that Nicks feels seen as valuable for her abilities, but not for herself. Little touches in the production elevate this song to grander levels. When you notice things like the light mmmm that Nicks hums at the very beginning, along with the bass drum getting a little louder at the word ""heartbeat"" to emulate that sound, it's clear that the band spent a lot of time making sure this song was perfect.

We then transition to Never Going Back Again, which might be my favorite song on the album, despite it being sandwiched amongst much more ambitious music on the A-side. From a technical standpoint, the fingerpicked guitar is superb, and serves as the driving force for the track due to the lack of percussion. Luckily that and the electric guitar provide more than enough instrumentation to keep you hooked, while Buckingham's frantic shouting in the chorus reveals a man who is hurt and angry. He resigns with ""I'm never going back again"", followed by an ooooohh that is sublime. Clocking in at only two minutes, I can't tell if the song is too short, or the perfect length to be played over and over again.

Don't Stop is the album's most explosive track; its chorus begs you to scream the words at the slow cars in the right lane as you pass by in your friend's '98 Toyota that you two thought would be a good idea to take a cross-country trip in until it breaks down about 7 hours in. The piano is the centerpiece of the song, as McVie furiously pounds the keys and harmonizes with Buckingham. The two are so in sync that you didn't even notice that Buckingham sings the first verse and Christine sings the second until you sat down to write this review. Following this is Go Your Own Way, which with its predecessor provide one of the gnarliest 1-2 punches of the 70's. Every band member, every instrument, gets a spotlight on this song. John McVie's bass is subtle but integral for the chorus to be funky. The acoustic guitar plays the same chords for three and a half minutes, establishing a baseline that allows the electric guitar to morph and evolve as the song moves along, culminating into one of the only guitar solos on the album and a grand crescendo, assisted by shouts of ""You can go your own way!"". My favorite aspect is Fleetwood's drumming, which gets a little bit more intricate for some incredible results, especially in the verses. And we haven't even talked about the lyrics, which are standard affair for this album by now but, once again, superbly delivered by Buckingham, who at this point has established his vocal style as a force to be reckoned with. Notice small things, like the second verse getting an extension to build tension before the chorus; there's good reason this song is still a hit almost four decades later.

At the conclusion of the first half, Christine McVie slows things in what is by far the most ballady song.  That's probably because Songbird directed at someone who isn't her ex-husband. Instead, she now looks forward to the new love she has found. This might be the one misstep of the album; the song itself is fine, but its placement is a huge comedown after the excitement of the first five songs. Luckily, The Chain picks things right back up. The bass kicks in and you feel like you're in an episode of ice road truckers, with the elements being your greatest enemy. Nicks and Buckingham continue to be perfectly in sync, ironically due to their mutual feelings of frustration and anger. This is the only song written by all five members of the band, and it's clear that all of them feel this way about someone. The song eventually turns into a loud jam sesh, as Fleetwood Mac's members are more than happy to let their instruments express what they can't, don't want to, or what won't be understood in their words. Members of the group have been quoted as not realizing when they were being talked about in another member's lyrics until after the album was released - sometimes it comes down to the music itself to do the talking.

Christine is clearly happy with her new partner, as we've seen both optimistic songs on the album from her. Obviously You Make Loving Fun is a shot at her former spouse, as this new relationship is a direct contrast to the feelings of imprisonment that come with being married to an angry drunk. The two relationships stand in stark contrast, and are thrown in John's face, who of course has a spotlight role in the song with his great bass lines. Keep an ear out for subtle wind chimes in the chorus, just another little detail that shows how meticulously crafted this album is.

I Don't Want to Know is my personal favorite track on the B-side. It's the only song on the album that was written prior to Buckingham and Nicks joining the band, and because of that, it's a lot more upbeat and flat-out fun. The repetition of the verse and chorus, with the bridge occasionally thrown in, lets the words of the two former lovers change with each echo. It's one of the band's most danceable songs; the handclaps and acoustic guitar take you to a backyard on a warm summer night, as you and your friends groove and fail miserably to sing along to a song you all only kind of know. Maybe he'll play Wonderwall next.

We're coming in towards the end, and to celebrate we get Oh Daddy, another ballad from Christine. This might be the only song that isn't directed at a romantic partner! Instead, it's directed at Fleetwood, who was often called the dad of the group due to his leadership and mature presence. Lyrically, however, the titular words are awkward to sing (though in 2016 I guess this counts as a meme), making this potentially the only non-hit of the album. Musically, it's great, and the backing vocals that repeat Christine's choruses are wonderful. 

The thrilling conclusion to this seminal album starts as anything but a thrill, preferring to take its time and feel out exactly what it wants to be. Here, in Gold Dust Woman, we end with Nicks battling over not only her love life, but her addiction to drugs, something that has clearly characterized her until this point. ""Rock on, gold dust woman"" definitely has some entendre behind it. The production, however, is the star of the show, creating a sense of foreboding and anxiety in the hollowness of the hushed instrumentation. The reverb on Nick's voice makes it sound like she's in a room alone, singing as her voice echoes back to her. Funny enough, she was, as in order for her to make it through the recording without crying it took dimming the lights and leaving her in the studio to sing until she nailed it. In a similar vein to The Chain, the track then turns into an all out jam, this one angrier and more abrasive. Nicks wants her audience to feel her pain, and if we can't through her words, we'll feel it through guitars.

You know what I'm talking about. Your favorite artist releases an awesome song and a banging video, but the radio play just never happens. The song peaks at #40 and slowly dies out over the next few weeks. WHY?! I'll start with:

[**Mariah Carey - I'll Be Loving You Long Time**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j16uymohGQ)
Now I'm a Mariah fanatic so I may be a little biased, but this song should have been a huge hit. It was the 3rd single off her E=MC2 album which spawned the hits ""Touch My Body"" and ""Bye Bye."" It has a great beat, catchy chorus, and is easy to sing along with (which I think a lot of Mariah's hits actually aren't, like Honey for example). Mariah also looked hot as hell in the video (this was before Dem Babies). But for whatever reason it only reached #58 on the Billboard Hot 100. I'm still playing the hell out of this song 7 years later!

[**Britney Spears - Radar**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-8y0FRg)
I LOVE THIS SONG. This is actually only 2nd to Toxic on my list of favorite Britney songs of all time. It was originally on the Blackout album, but wasn't actually released as a single until it was included as a bonus track for Circus. This is one Britney's catchiest choruses ever, and the electropop synth backing track makes it a great club jam. The video is admittedly a bit uninspired, but Brit looks great and the male lead is very attractive. Only reached #88 on the Billboard Hot 100. :'(

So, what are your favorite songs that had dismal chart performances? Discuss!  Oh yeah, I was going back through more random Billboard chart years (cause I'm currently protesting work right now) and agree the 70s definitely had the most random artists topping the charts. Surprisingly less disco than I expected though, but my idea of disco is probably more things like Sylvester and Giorgio Moroder.

I loved seeing something completely random and raunchy like Silk's ""FREAK ME"" get two weeks at #1 back in 93 and I can't believe fucking Bryan Adams has several #1 hits while The Boss is still at zero.

I think ""Here"" isn't just a simple song about an introverted ""anti-social pessimist"" who finds herself lost in a house party. It's about an  extraterrestrial infiltrated within society who just had their first contact with a party on Earth. Notice how Alessia describes every single detail of the party, like if it were her first time in one.

The first thing that should be noticed is she uses different terms to refer to people. Confront these two lines:

***""But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it""***

***""But honestly I'd rather be somewhere with my people""***

Fans of the song claim that Alessia is at that party against her will to please her friends. But that wouldn't make any sense, considering she already has a group where they have deep discussions and listen to meaningful music. So why bother with a bunch of party-heads?

It's simple. The people who Alessia refers to as her ""friends"" are the Earthlings she is forced to live together with because of the infiltration. ""My people"", however, obviously refers to her fellow aliens.

These lines make it clear what the aliens' intentions are:

""***We can kick it and just listen to***

***Some music with a message, like we usually do***

***And we'll discuss our big dreams***

***How we plan to take over the planet***""

The ""music with a message"" refers to the signals received from other aliens, possibly from their home planet (though it also could be from other locations on Earth). The rest is pretty obvious: they want to take over the planet.

We have to agree that humans tend to behave differently in day-to-day situations (work, school, etc) and in parties. Alessia, as an infiltrated agent, only used to see people in normal circumstances, and was shocked to see the drastic differences in behaviour at the party, especially under the influence of alcohol (***""Right next to the boy who's throwing' up / Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more""***) and drugs (***""Somewhere in the corner / Under clouds of marijuana""***). She is also annoyed by other practices, such as the girl's gossiping or the boy hitting on her:

* ***""I don't dance, don't ask / I don't need a boyfriend""***

* ***""With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends""***

* ***""Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none""***

In fact, she hates that part of the job so much that she feels like she's in prison, hence the need to break out: ***""And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here...""***.

It's a very interesting song when you think about it this way. 10/10 chuckled throughout

 This week the stuff I listened to reads like a what's what of things /r/popheads didn't like: 

Mind of Mine - I liked this album to begin with, and every song has only gotten better the more I listen to it. Even from people who liked it I haven't seen one person mention TiO which is awesome. (And of course the obligatory She, the singles, etc, I just wanted to point out something underrated but I love almost every song on here)

Get Ugly - I swear earlier in the week I had this on repeat. It's so fun in every way to sing along to and dance to. Tbh there are at least four really great songs off this album and this is one of them. Straight banger, it is such a JAM.

 This week the stuff I listened to reads like a what's what of things /r/popheads didn't like: 

Mind of Mine - I liked this album to begin with, and every song has only gotten better the more I listen to it. Even from people who liked it I haven't seen one person mention TiO which is awesome. (And of course the obligatory She, the singles, etc, I just wanted to point out something underrated but I love almost every song on here)

Get Ugly - I swear earlier in the week I had this on repeat. It's so fun in every way to sing along to and dance to. Tbh there are at least four really great songs off this album and this is one of them. Straight banger, it is such a JAM.

Some obvious choices, some hipster choices.

Michael Jackson, the king of pop, had an unprecedented and unrepeated impact on the world of music and entertainment. His songs and videos are part of global culture and among the most recognizable pieces of art in the world. 

Most of this astonishing success and fame was based on Michael's success with his brothers in the 70's, and his solo albums in the 80's which catapulted into a level of world fame unseen in history. But you will find that among fans, the music that he went on to make in the 90's and beyond is often more popular than his blockbuster albums *Off The Wall, Bad* and *Thriller*. 

Here is my attempt for a guide to Michael Jackson, starting from *Off The Wall* and ending with his last album in 2001, *Invincible*.

**Off The Wall, 1979**

Not many people know this, but up until Thriller, Off The Wall was the best selling album by a black musician ever. Michael was already a world famous star, but this was his first project as a solo artist, no longer cushioned by Motown, but aided by legendary producer Quincy Jones. 

Off The Wall is disco's last stand: a smooth, polished and joyful masterpiece of soul, funk and pop which has Michael's young voice stutter, sigh and croon his way through a stunning collection of tracks.

3 highlights:
*Don't Stop Til You Get Enough*: written by Michael Jackson, this track opened the album and set the tone for the album. Sexual in a playful, innocent tone, the bassline and beat for this song is irresistible. Michael's falsetto voice was recorded on several tracks to make it sound stronger and more vibrant.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZorRGrDiMsA

*Rock With You*: the following track takes the theme of dance and love a step further. The drums are on point, the harmonies on the chorus are tight, and the vocals are both innocent and sensual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X-Mrc2l1d0

*I Can't Help It*: a secret fan favourite. This Stevie Wonder-inspired track is a dreamy, soulful gem. Michael experiments with his voice, sending it all over the song in a half-whisper, with excellent lyrics describing the feeling of helpless love in an artful way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnhWML43NI8

**Thriller, 1982**

This album needs little introduction, but its success cannot be understated. Thriller was a cultural phenomenon. Michael Jackson reached every demographic in the world by adding onto his disco repertoire with pop, funk, soul and even a bitching rock track. Quincy Jones produced this besteller album, but Michael Jackson became more involved as an artist, writing some of the most memorable tunes of the album himself.

*Beat It*: written by Michael, this song is a unique moment in pop history. A pop artist did a rock song and made it into a monster hit. The chorus is the most catchy thing since the cold, the guitar solo is provided by Van Halen, and Michael Jackson's vocals are impossible to imitate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym0hZG-zNOk

*Human Nature*: this ballad is often overshadowed by Thriller's 'holy trinity', but in my opinion deserves to be here more than almost any other track on the album. The lyrics conjure up a cityscape at nightfall, dreaming of being free-spirited and connecting with other human beings. It is an ethereal, unapologetic and mysterious statement of a desire to be oneself. Michael Jackson delivers the song in a breathy, soaring voice - to contrast with his live performances of the song, where he turned this ballad into a much more erotic experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKAh--ss1r0&amp;gl=BE

*Billie Jean*: Quincy Jones didn't like this track that Michael had written, but it ended up on the album anyway. Who knows what had happened if it didn't. This snare drum is one of the most recognizable sounds in music today. Whereas Michael used to deal with love and dancing, this song and others on the album deal with the bad side of fame; the lyrics are claustrophobic, the vocals sound distant, pained and alien. Live performances for this song became a staple for any Michael Jackson show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y

**Bad, 1987**

With Thriller, MJ had conquered the world with a pop album that touched on funk, rock and soul. Bad was his intention to go further in every way. His last collaboration with Quincy was an adventurous, bold, agressive album, abandoning many of the themes and sounds that hade made him famous and borrowing heavily from synth pop and funk. Bad was a statement of maturity and being in control, and to this day remains an addictive listening experience. Choosing only 3 highlights from this album is a harrowingly difficult experience.

*Smooth Criminal*: an unorthodox song; almost the entire track consists of the chorus, which is a hasty, panicked ordeal. The song has a scary atmosphere, dealing with the murder of a woman and the desperate cries of her loved ones to see if she still lives. Michael's voice had never sounded like this before; no longer his boyish whisper but a growling voice insisting to be heard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrWNbjw3RA

*Man In The Mirror*: this song, surprisingly, was not written by Jackson, but it breathes his very essence. A heartfelt ballad that comes straight from the heart pleads for peace and understanding in a desperate world. The second part of the song is a pinnacle moment of the album, where Michael's raspy voice screams for the listener to change himself and change the world. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PivWY9wn5ps

*Leave Me Alone*: this song was only featured on the CD for Bad, not on the vinyl, as a promotion tool to buy it as well. Coupled with a unique video, the beat is hard and unrelenting, it is full of life and defiance and some of the best harmonies and background vocals you'll hear on any pop record. Also an excellent example of Michael Jackson's vocals becoming the trademark 'gritty' growl of his later career, showcasing rawness and emotion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crbFmpezO4A

**Dangerous, 1991**

We have entered the last decade of the century, and Michael Jackson decided to reinvent himself. To react on the rise of new jack swing, hiphop and a more urban tone, Jackson got himself a new producer and a new attitude. Bad was in many ways a celebration of black music; Dangerous became a two-sided affair. The first half of the album focused on steamy and funky tracks produced by Teddy Riley, while the second half featured Michael's epic pop music at its very finest. Lyrical themes of isolation, confusion and the power of love and desire stood in contrast with themes of hope, optimism and celebration.

*Who Is It*: in my opinion, Michael's best pop song ever. This song is like Billie Jean all grown up. A strong bassline coupled with a simplistic beat drags us into a world of paranoia and confusion, as Michael Jackson cries out against the loss of his partner and his loneliness. The repetitive ending was inspired by rave and dance music that would hypnotise its listener.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgGVvUhMJ5Q

*Give In To Me*: Slash joins MJ for his obligatory rock track and plays not one but *two* full guitar solos, as Michael seems to demand love and satisfaction with an increasingly agonizing chorus. This song grabs you immediately and never lets you go. And credits where due, the guitar play on this track is unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ7qXHjxj_0

*Will You Be There*: prepare for 90's nostalgia with this Free Willy soundtrack song. MJ goes for gospel music (a throwback to his black heritage, as many of his songs do) in a warm and spirited song. As the choir seems to sing MJ into heaven, the song finished with a somewhat theatrical, but poignant spoken word monologue by the singer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUaMzwNPgro

**HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, 1997**

The past years had not been kind on the singer. A scandal in 1993 dethroned the pop star and made many turn their backs on him. Coupled with a great deal of failed ventures and troubled times in the world, this album continued the pattern in his albums. From 1979 to 1991, MJ had increasingly left love songs behind and had dealt with loneliness, agony and despair at the state of the world coupled with hope, optimism and a desire to make it all okay. HIStory is one of the most politically charged pop albums ever made, and a deeply personal, agressive and sometimes even spiteful record. Pop stars have never shown this level of passion for real-world issues. Many fans consider this late 90's work his masterpiece, as it is the most personal and passionate in his oeuvre. It features tracks that talk of sensationalism, racism, capitalism, child abuse, environmental issues, in a bold and unexpected move from a troubled pop star.

*They Don't Care About Us*: this song has no mask or no metaphors. It talks of the persecution of minorities in the United States, either in the first or third person. The beat is simplistic, like a marching army, the vocals are raw and unprocessed, the accompanying video is completely unlike anything the pop star had ever done before. MJ decries the way his country has been evolving and wonders whether the government still has us in their best interests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1pqi8vjTLY

*Stranger In Moscow*: this song is something else. Haunting, mournful, melancholic and musically pitch perfect, Michael Jackson talks of fame and infamy. Written in a lonely hotel room while fans cried his name outside on the street, it just sounds so unrelentingly sad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEEMi2j6lYE

*Money*: I would have gone for Earth Song here, which combines both his somber and sad side, and his courageous, defiant and passionate side, but this song showcases what HIStory means the best. It's strange, almost has no rhythm at all, and is borderline incomprehensible. Michael Jackson sings with disgust about the love of money and what people would do for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-3BtSD46DI

(Another song that summarises the atmosphere of the album is the perfectly crafted wonder that is *Tabloid Junkie*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niJzmX2U-J0. Lyrics are advised.)

**Blood On The Dance Floor**

Blood On The Dance Floor is not a studio album, but a remix album featuring 5 new tracks. Those tracks, however, reveal what could potentially have been the most intellectual, self-aware and haunting pop album he could have ever made. These lyrics talk of drug abuse, the sexualisation of society and, most poignantly of all, they talk of Michael Jackson and his freaky, scandalous image in the world. If this was followed upon to make a full album, it would be something else.

*Morphine*: in this song Michael Jackson unabashedly sings about his own drug addiction. The lyrics are tough to decipher; they play around with perspective and focalisation, but the message is clear. Michael Jackson had a painkiller addiction (the song's breakdown mentions 'Demerol' repeatedly) and he hated himself for it. The song was inspired by Nine Inch Nail's Downward Spiral, as stated by Jackson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiDyX0fCjvg

*Blood On The Dance Floor*: it's been a while since this guy made a song that simply talked of love and/or dancing! Michael Jackson doesn't sing, but whispers his lyrics of a murderous seductress. Many people believe this song alludes to sexually transmitted diseases, specifically AIDS. It's also a freaking good dance song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3_NntYhzV4

*Is It Scary*: this song is very interesting. Lyrics are often inaccurate, but the song speaks for itself. While its 'brother' song Ghosts talked about jealousy in a paranormal setting, this song conjures up a world of ghosts and ghouls to talk of something else: Michael Jackson. The song is Michael Jackson's statement to the world: ""if you really want me to be a freak and a monster, I guess I'll be that for you. But deep down I know I'm just a human being, and you are the monsters for persecuting me"". Like the message or not, it's a very interesting track that serves as a rarely-heard reply to the most hateful of comments on his life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfgLSVSWWGw

**Invincible, 2001**
His last 'real' studio album seems to have been an admission on MJ's part that his previous efforts had been extraordinarily dark for a pop album. While I consider it a bit disappointing that he turned his back on the political and biographical tracks, Invincible is still a welcome return to pop and soul. While it's a bit heavy on the ballads, Invincible is an updated Thriller that sounded dated when it came out, and then started to sound sort of revolutionary. These highlights are not necessarily the best on the album, but ones that represent its nature well.

*Whatever Happens*: Michael Jackson, with Carlos Santana on the guitar, channels latin pop with this passionate ballad of two lovers dealing with a troublesome relationship. It is not very well known outside the fan base and deserves much more listeners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZlmFdG5mpA

*2000 Watts*: I put this in here to show off this very unexpected MJ song. It's a pure dance track to be played in clubs, with Jackson using an uncharacteristically low voice. The song uses music equipment as a metaphor for sex, pure and simple. It deserves attention for being an adventurous step to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR2kioBhP-Y

*Speechless*: you'll either love it or not. It is a typical Michael Jackson ballad. Starts out as a simple a capella, ends with a choir and a reference to his world hit 'You Are Not Alone' in the background. Personally I love it, and listening to the beginning with good speakers on gives me goosebumps. If you're into pop ballads, give it a try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtpGUcieFGk


Now, there's a lot of tracks out there still, but I kept myself to these 7 albums and 3 'highlights'. There's a lot more to Michael Jackson's music than one might think. His pop beginnings soon became an adventure into much more political issues. Not many pop artists have sung so passionately about racism, child abuse and drug addiction as MJ; and perhaps it is only logical for the public to appreciate those tracks less. Of course, the portrayal of his personal life was also greatly detrimental to his career and has led many to ignore his musical accomplishments starting from Dangerous.

I hope this was somewhat helpful and may inspire people to give MJ another good listen, and appreciate the man for the path his music so boldly took, the barriers he has broken and the many, many hearts he has touched and inspired.
 I find many pop fans sort of take him for granted: ""He's the best, classic songs, king of pop"" etc. etc. but never really listen to all his stuff or call it their favourite music. He's suspiciously missing in many lists and ""top x"" posts. It's like people listen to everyone around him and not him specifically. When you really listen to all he did, there's no escaping it. He was truly the greatest. His every album should be in every pop fan's music library.",Don't Stop Til You Get Enough,Michael Jackson,84.6153846153846,66.6666666666666,"[""disco's last stand: smooth, polished and joyful masterpiece of soul, funk and pop"", ""bassline and beat of 'Don't Stop Til You Get Enough' is irresistible"", ""Michael's falsetto voice was recorded on several tracks to make it sound stronger and more vibrant"", ""drums on 'Rock With You' are on point, harmonies on chorus are tight"", ""Michael's voice on 'I Can't Help It' is a half-whisper"", ""guitar solo on 'Beat It' is provided by Van Halen"", ""lyrics of 'Human Nature' conjure up a cityscape at nightfall"", ""snare drum of 'Billie Jean' is one of the most recognizable sounds in music today"", ""hard and unrelenting beat of 'Leave Me Alone'"", ""strong bassline coupled with a simplistic beat in 'Who Is It'"", ""repeat ending of 'Who Is It' was inspired by rave and dance music"", ""two guitar solos in 'Give In To Me' by Slash"", ""warm and spirited gospel music in 'Will You Be There'"", ""raw and unprocessed vocals in 'They Don't Care About Us'"", ""haunting, mournful, melancholic sound of 'Stranger In Moscow'"", ""complexity and almost no rhythm in 'Money'""]","[""Michael's best pop song 'Who Is It' is like Billie Jean all grown up"", ""Morphine was inspired by Nine Inch Nail's Downward Spiral"", ""Michael's voice in 'Smooth Criminal' is a departure from the boyish whisper to a growling insistence""]","[""fans cried his name outside the hotel while writing 'Stranger In Moscow'""]","[""scary atmosphere of 'Smooth Criminal'"", ""mysterious statement of desire to be oneself in 'Human Nature'"", ""ethereal and unapologetic feel of 'Human Nature'"", ""pinnacle moment with Michael's raspy voice in 'Man In The Mirror'"", ""rawness and emotion in the 'gritty' growl of Michael's later vocals"", ""ominous, haunting nature of 'Is It Scary'""]",,"['Off The Wall was the best selling album by a black musician before Thriller', 'Michael Jackson collaborated with Quincy Jones', ""Van Halen played guitar solo on 'Beat It'"", ""Slash played guitar in 'Give In To Me'"", ""Free Willy soundtrack song is 'Will You Be There'"", ""'Blood On The Dance Floor' album was a remix album with 5 new tracks"", ""Invincible is Michael Jackson's last 'real' studio album""]","[[""Don't Stop Til You Get Enough"", 'Michael Jackson'], ['Rock With You', 'Michael Jackson'], [""I Can't Help It"", 'Michael Jackson'], ['Beat It', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Human Nature', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Billie Jean', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Smooth Criminal', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Man In The Mirror', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Leave Me Alone', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Who Is It', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Give In To Me', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Will You Be There', 'Michael Jackson'], [""They Don't Care About Us"", 'Michael Jackson'], ['Stranger In Moscow', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Money', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Morphine', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Blood On The Dance Floor', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Is It Scary', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Whatever Happens', 'Michael Jackson'], ['2000 Watts', 'Michael Jackson'], ['Speechless', 'Michael Jackson']]"," Sexual in a playful, innocent tone, the bassline and beat for this song is irresistible.

Michael Jackson, the king of pop, had an unprecedented and unrepeated impact on the world of music and entertainment. His songs and videos are part of global culture and among the most recognizable pieces of art in the world. 

Most of this astonishing success and fame was based on Michael's success with his brothers in the 70's, and his solo albums in the 80's which catapulted into a level of world fame unseen in history. But you will find that among fans, the music that he went on to make in the 90's and beyond is often more popular than his blockbuster albums *Off The Wall, Bad* and *Thriller*. 

Here is my attempt for a guide to Michael Jackson, starting from *Off The Wall* and ending with his last album in 2001, *Invincible*.

The past years had not been kind on the singer. A scandal in 1993 dethroned the pop star and made many turn their backs on him. Coupled with a great deal of failed ventures and troubled times in the world, this album continued the pattern in his albums. From 1979 to 1991, MJ had increasingly left love songs behind and had dealt with loneliness, agony and despair at the state of the world coupled with hope, optimism and a desire to make it all okay. HIStory is one of the most politically charged pop albums ever made, and a deeply personal, agressive and sometimes even spiteful record. Pop stars have never shown this level of passion for real-world issues. Many fans consider this late 90's work his masterpiece, as it is the most personal and passionate in his oeuvre. It features tracks that talk of sensationalism, racism, capitalism, child abuse, environmental issues, in a bold and unexpected move from a troubled pop star.

*They Don't Care About Us*: this song has no mask or no metaphors. It talks of the persecution of minorities in the United States, either in the first or third person. The beat is simplistic, like a marching army, the vocals are raw and unprocessed, the accompanying video is completely unlike anything the pop star had ever done before. MJ decries the way his country has been evolving and wonders whether the government still has us in their best interests.

*Stranger In Moscow*: this song is something else. Haunting, mournful, melancholic and musically pitch perfect, Michael Jackson talks of fame and infamy. Written in a lonely hotel room while fans cried his name outside on the street, it just sounds so unrelentingly sad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEEMi2j6lYE

*Money*: I would have gone for Earth Song here, which combines both his somber and sad side, and his courageous, defiant and passionate side, but this song showcases what HIStory means the best. It's strange, almost has no rhythm at all, and is borderline incomprehensible. Michael Jackson sings with disgust about the love of money and what people would do for it.

(Another song that summarises the atmosphere of the album is the perfectly crafted wonder that is *Tabloid Junkie*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niJzmX2U-J0. Lyrics are advised.)

**Blood On The Dance Floor**

Blood On The Dance Floor is not a studio album, but a remix album featuring 5 new tracks. Those tracks, however, reveal what could potentially have been the most intellectual, self-aware and haunting pop album he could have ever made. These lyrics talk of drug abuse, the sexualisation of society and, most poignantly of all, they talk of Michael Jackson and his freaky, scandalous image in the world. If this was followed upon to make a full album, it would be something else.

*Morphine*: in this song Michael Jackson unabashedly sings about his own drug addiction. The lyrics are tough to decipher; they play around with perspective and focalisation, but the message is clear. Michael Jackson had a painkiller addiction (the song's breakdown mentions 'Demerol' repeatedly) and he hated himself for it. The song was inspired by Nine Inch Nail's Downward Spiral, as stated by Jackson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiDyX0fCjvg

*Blood On The Dance Floor*: it's been a while since this guy made a song that simply talked of love and/or dancing! Michael Jackson doesn't sing, but whispers his lyrics of a murderous seductress. Many people believe this song alludes to sexually transmitted diseases, specifically AIDS. It's also a freaking good dance song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3_NntYhzV4

*Is It Scary*: this song is very interesting. Lyrics are often inaccurate, but the song speaks for itself. While its 'brother' song Ghosts talked about jealousy in a paranormal setting, this song conjures up a world of ghosts and ghouls to talk of something else: Michael Jackson. The song is Michael Jackson's statement to the world: ""if you really want me to be a freak and a monster, I guess I'll be that for you. But deep down I know I'm just a human being, and you are the monsters for persecuting me"". Like the message or not, it's a very interesting track that serves as a rarely-heard reply to the most hateful of comments on his life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfgLSVSWWGw

**Invincible, 2001**
His last 'real' studio album seems to have been an admission on MJ's part that his previous efforts had been extraordinarily dark for a pop album. While I consider it a bit disappointing that he turned his back on the political and biographical tracks, Invincible is still a welcome return to pop and soul. While it's a bit heavy on the ballads, Invincible is an updated Thriller that sounded dated when it came out, and then started to sound sort of revolutionary. These highlights are not necessarily the best on the album, but ones that represent its nature well.

*Whatever Happens*: Michael Jackson, with Carlos Santana on the guitar, channels latin pop with this passionate ballad of two lovers dealing with a troublesome relationship. It is not very well known outside the fan base and deserves much more listeners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZlmFdG5mpA

*2000 Watts*: I put this in here to show off this very unexpected MJ song. It's a pure dance track to be played in clubs, with Jackson using an uncharacteristically low voice. The song uses music equipment as a metaphor for sex, pure and simple. It deserves attention for being an adventurous step to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR2kioBhP-Y

*Speechless*: you'll either love it or not. It is a typical Michael Jackson ballad. Starts out as a simple a capella, ends with a choir and a reference to his world hit 'You Are Not Alone' in the background. Personally I love it, and listening to the beginning with good speakers on gives me goosebumps. If you're into pop ballads, give it a try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtpGUcieFGk


Now, there's a lot of tracks out there still, but I kept myself to these 7 albums and 3 'highlights'. There's a lot more to Michael Jackson's music than one might think. His pop beginnings soon became an adventure into much more political issues. Not many pop artists have sung so passionately about racism, child abuse and drug addiction as MJ; and perhaps it is only logical for the public to appreciate those tracks less. Of course, the portrayal of his personal life was also greatly detrimental to his career and has led many to ignore his musical accomplishments starting from Dangerous.

I hope this was somewhat helpful and may inspire people to give MJ another good listen, and appreciate the man for the path his music so boldly took, the barriers he has broken and the many, many hearts he has touched and inspired.
 I find many pop fans sort of take him for granted: ""He's the best, classic songs, king of pop"" etc. etc. but never really listen to all his stuff or call it their favourite music. He's suspiciously missing in many lists and ""top x"" posts. It's like people listen to everyone around him and not him specifically. When you really listen to all he did, there's no escaping it. He was truly the greatest.

* [**Wikipedia Entry**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity_\(The_Police_album\))

&gt;**Artist Background:**

&gt;The Police are a reggae-peppered new wave rock band hailing from London, England. They were formed in 1977 by [Stewart Copeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Copeland) (drums), [Andy Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Summers) (guitar), and [Sting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(musician\)) (lead vocals and bass; born Gordon Sumner). The group is generally considered to have been at the forefront of the new wave movement, with the release of their first album, [*Outlandos d'Amour*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlandos_d'Amour), coming out all the way back in 1978. The band has five studio albums in total, of which Synchronicity is the ultimate one, in many senses. 

&gt;The band split up in 1986 owing mostly to Sting [**persuing a solo career in music**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(musician\)#Solo) ([**and film**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoPKajvq3gE)) as well as friction between the members and scheduling conflicts in their attempts to record their sixth studio album.

* [**Walking on the Moon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nt8dJ6rMZI)

***

**Album Background:**

Synchronicity has sold 8.3 million copies in the US alone, more than double that of their second-most successful album, [*Ghost in the Machine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Machine_(album\)). It's also gone platinum in the United Kingdom, Canada, and France. It topped the album charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. The album boasts four US top 40 hits (""[Synchronicity II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLmjjyxhoMY),"" ""[King of Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgSCKXSp9M),"" ""[Every Breath You Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOGaugKpzs),"" and ""[Wrapped Around Your Finger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svWINSRhQU0)""). Three of these landed them in the top 10, and one of them, ""Every Breath You Take,"" snagged a number 1 spot, and went Gold in the process.

***

**Musical Description:**

As far as the musical direction of the album, it is certainly the band's most accessible and pop-centric in their discography, and certainly their best album as a complete work of art. Many of their others had lots of half-baked bits of filler and dreamy reggae detours, but this album, despite its continued use of Sting's echoey, dreamy voice, stays on target. Though still having that reggae-flecked outer shell, the band goes full-on new wave for much of *Synchronicity's* 44 minute runtime. The vocals are painted in reverb as most of Sting's vocals and all of the backing vocals sound as if they're being recorded in a cathedral with all the echo attached to them. The album doesn't punch, it just sort of washes over you and, by the end, you feel like you've definitely learned something about Sting's state of mind in 1983.

***

**Standout Tracks:**

* [""Mother""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbAOsW6iiKk) - An off-kilter, unnerving venting session of Andy Summers' issues with his mother and his love life.

* [""Every Breath You Take""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOGaugKpzs) - Described by many as a stalker's confession of his stalkery ways, I prefer to think of it as an explanation of the frustrations and life of a person *deep* into the pursuit of unrequited love (with a little bit of stalking on the side).

* [""Synchronicity II""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLmjjyxhoMY) - Commentary on how we're all disconnected from ourselves, and how fucked up modern society really is, very rarely hits the mark, but ""Synchronicity II"" does it very well. We're hurting ourselves with the lives we live and there's a monster bubbling up and, and if we don't make attempts to keep it down, it'll come out of the Scottish loch we've kept it in and it's shadow will be on our door whether we like it or not.

**Discussion**

* First and foremost, what do you think of the album? What rating would you give it out of 10?

* Were you around when it was released? Reach inside your geriatric old brain and pull out what you thought of the thing at the time: has your opinion on the album changed?

* Have you heard the album before today? Have you listened to The Police before today? If not, you should! We're discussing this album and this artist for a reason! (It's good!!)

* What's your favorite song on the album?

* What's your least favorite song on the album?

* How does this album hold up in the artist's discography?

* What should next week's Classic Album of the Week be? Keep in mind that, for the moment anyway, Classic Album of the Week is exclusively for pop albums that came out before 2000. There are many great albums that've come out in the new millennium worth discussing, but that's why we've got Throwback Thursday, quite frankly.

Please listen to this album and share your thoughts, even if they don't respond to one of the questions above. If you dig this kind of music, listen to some of the other hits/albums in this artist's discography! If you don't dig this particular entry into this genre, try out other music in it!! Normally down here I'll let you know what next week's classic album will be, but for now I'll see what the reaction to this even is.

Have a good day, I love you all. I'm so glad Synchronicity is album of the week--it was my introduction to the Police when I was an angsty 16 year old. I wasn't born when the album was released, but it's still interesting to see how it holds up thirty years later. I'm partial to the Police's quirkier tracks, so I like ""Miss Gradenko"" and ""Wrapped around Your Finger."" 

Personally, I think Synchronicity is a bit pretentious. Saying that the album ""just washes over you"" is pretty accurate. Synchronicity, in my opinion, is the transition from punk Sting to easy listening Sting. Overall a good album, though--probably 7/10 for me.

If I were introducing a friend to the Police, I'd probably start them with Reggatta de Blanc or Ghost in the Machine. These albums have more spirit and more of that Police-y fusion of reggae and punk. If this person enjoyed the Sting-isms of Ghost in the Machine, I'd probably transition to Synchronicity.

I feel like the only tracks that become mainstream here are gimmik-y ones like ""Gangnam Style""


**A few of my favorites:**

[Øm - Bilderbuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yo2WOJ4WMY) -- Honestly amazing and fresh song, brings out super strange happy vibe

[Red - HyunA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTXCgR93zC8)  --literally had this song on repeat for a month, kinda makes me sick every time I hear it now but its fine.

-also HyunA [Roll Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib_1ATfr8wM) --Super fucking hypocritical about my kpop title, but she has to be mentioned ""Bubble Pop!"" is a classic


[Cookie Thumper - Die Antwoord](https://youtu.be/K8nrF5aXPlQ?t=140) -- OH MY GOD THIS SONG IS AMAZING If you dont know about die antwoord, you're welcome

[The Flowers Leave - Aristophanes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnY3VxKqcsM) (Not pop) -- Amazingly **unique** and beautiful, been listening to her stuff ever since Art Angels came out *(she is featured on [SCREAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUe9rnucPoU) if anyone is wondering)*


**EDIT: - -- - ALMOST FORGOT THE BEST ONE [Ленинград — Рыба](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-CnWwbeetE)** [Francisca Valenzuela - Que Seria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WQHGQR69JI)

One of my favorite non-english songs, I listen regularly to her albums and she's fantastic. Her lyrics and piano skills are pretty cool.

[Javiera Mena - Luz de Piedra Luna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atjmVa8k-vc)

More synth than Francisca, still a nice fun tune, reminds me of the 80's, like much of Javiera's work. The lyrics are kinda meh for me personally.

[Los Prisioneros - El Baile de Los Que Sobran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-YAnmsbnKM)

My fathers jammed to this back in the 80's and is still an awesome song. Catchy music + Smart social conscious lyrics.

**Artist background:**

[Kate Bush](http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/195/kate_bush_82973.jpg) is a British singer, songwriter and producer and one of the most important figures in art pop, baroque pop and progressive pop. She began music at the young age of 16 and released her first album *The Kick Inside* in 1978, which was met with moderately positive reviews. She started to build an audience within Britain, continuing a steady stream of albums predominantly in the baroque pop lane, including *Never For Ever* in 1980 and *The Dreaming* in 1982. But it wasn't until the 1985 release of *Hounds Of Love* that Kate was met with international success. Not only was the album her most popular work, it was also her most acclaimed release, garnering universal appraisal from critics and listeners alike for its innovative and eclectic sounds, produced entirely by Kate herself.

After the massive success of *Hounds Of Love*, Kate Bush continued to release albums that have garnered very positive receptions, and have added to her reputation a legend of contemporary music.

**Album description:**

One of the most distinct and important aspects of *Hounds Of Love* is the big contrast between the two halves of the album. The first half of the album (tracks 1-5) feature tracks such as Running Up That Hill, The Big Sky and Hounds Of Love. These tracks follow a style that is instantaneous; big choruses, punchy drums, grand orchestral instrumentation, synth work and of course, Kate's distinct and visceral vocals. The second half of the album (tracks 6-12), titled *The Ninth Wave*, is a complete change of pace compared to the first half. Here Kate is playing with more experimental, darker (Waking The Witch), minimal (Watching You Without Me) and eclectic (Jig Of Life) sounds that would've been hard to imagine on the same record as the first six tracks. *The Ninth Wave*'s surrealism and abstraction puts Kate in a much more vulnerable and introspective position compared to the first half of the album, with more solemn and personal moments.

Since its release, *Hounds Of Love* has gone to be a massive influence within the pop scene, particularly among baroque and art pop artists such as Bjork, The Knife, Grimes and Florence + The Machine.

___
**Standout tracks:**

* [**Running Up That Hill**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM)

What a fantastic way to start an album. This track features massive drums, a cinematic atmosphere courtesy of the airy synthesisers and one of Bush's most impassioned deliveries. Lyrically the song delves into idea of a man and a woman swapping places to have an idea their relationship from the other's point of view. Not only is this one of Kate's best tracks, it's also one of her most commercially successful tracks.

* [**Watching You Without Me**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9WGqjmScs8)

My personal favourite off The Ninth Wave side of the album. Minimalism is what makes this song so amazing. It's mellow, subtle and spacious with Kate sounding like an angel. Definitely a sound that wouldn't feel too out of place alongside some of today's art pop.

* [**Hounds Of Love**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VerK4zwMRQw)

The title track of this album. *Hounds Of Love* is a euphoric tune, with bright synth leads and Kate's signature punchy drums which kick the track off. She sounds dramatic and desperate on this track, with a vocal delivery that feels convincing. One of the highlights of the entire album.

[Kate Bush](http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/195/kate_bush_82973.jpg) is a British singer, songwriter and producer and one of the most important figures in art pop, baroque pop and progressive pop. She began music at the young age of 16 and released her first album *The Kick Inside* in 1978, which was met with moderately positive reviews. She started to build an audience within Britain, continuing a steady stream of albums predominantly in the baroque pop lane, including *Never For Ever* in 1980 and *The Dreaming* in 1982. But it wasn't until the 1985 release of *Hounds Of Love* that Kate was met with international success. Not only was the album her most popular work, it was also her most acclaimed release, garnering universal appraisal from critics and listeners alike for its innovative and eclectic sounds, produced entirely by Kate herself.

After the massive success of *Hounds Of Love*, Kate Bush continued to release albums that have garnered very positive receptions, and have added to her reputation a legend of contemporary music.

**Album description:**

One of the most distinct and important aspects of *Hounds Of Love* is the big contrast between the two halves of the album. The first half of the album (tracks 1-5) feature tracks such as Running Up That Hill, The Big Sky and Hounds Of Love. These tracks follow a style that is instantaneous; big choruses, punchy drums, grand orchestral instrumentation, synth work and of course, Kate's distinct and visceral vocals. The second half of the album (tracks 6-12), titled *The Ninth Wave*, is a complete change of pace compared to the first half. Here Kate is playing with more experimental, darker (Waking The Witch), minimal (Watching You Without Me) and eclectic (Jig Of Life) sounds that would've been hard to imagine on the same record as the first six tracks. *The Ninth Wave*'s surrealism and abstraction puts Kate in a much more vulnerable and introspective position compared to the first half of the album, with more solemn and personal moments.

Since its release, *Hounds Of Love* has gone to be a massive influence within the pop scene, particularly among baroque and art pop artists such as Bjork, The Knife, Grimes and Florence + The Machine.

**Standout tracks:**

* [**Running Up That Hill**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM)

What a fantastic way to start an album. This track features massive drums, a cinematic atmosphere courtesy of the airy synthesisers and one of Bush's most impassioned deliveries. Lyrically the song delves into idea of a man and a woman swapping places to have an idea their relationship from the other's point of view. Not only is this one of Kate's best tracks, it's also one of her most commercially successful tracks.

* [**Watching You Without Me**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9WGqjmScs8)

My personal favourite off The Ninth Wave side of the album. Minimalism is what makes this song so amazing. It's mellow, subtle and spacious with Kate sounding like an angel. Definitely a sound that wouldn't feel too out of place alongside some of today's art pop.

* [**Hounds Of Love**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VerK4zwMRQw)

The title track of this album. *Hounds Of Love* is a euphoric tune, with bright synth leads and Kate's signature punchy drums which kick the track off. She sounds dramatic and desperate on this track, with a vocal delivery that feels convincing. One of the highlights of the entire album.

**Discussion:**

* First and foremost, what do you think of the album? What rating would you give it out of 10?

* Were you around when it was released? Reach inside your geriatric old brain and pull out what you thought of the thing at the time: has your opinion on the album changed?

* Have you heard the album before today? Have you listened to Kate Bush before today? If not, you should! We're discussing this album and this artist for a reason! (It's good!)

* What's your favorite song on the album?

* What's your least favorite song on the album?

* How does this album hold up in the artist's discography?

* What should next week's Classic Album of the Week be? Keep in mind that, for the moment anyway, Classic Album of the Week is exclusively for pop albums that came out before 2000. There are many great albums that've come out in the new millennium worth discussing, but that's why we've got Throwback Thursday, quite frankly. /u/TheAllRightGatsby * This needs a lot more up votes. 

FWIW, I was in college when *Hounds of Love* came out; I first heard *Running Up That Hill* on the local college station. The song just absolutely grabbed me, and I was hooked. Bought the CD as soon as I could find it.

Hey everyone, I had a weird thought recently, that I wanted to share. I've played a lot of video games as a kid, growing up, and for me an integral part of those games was the music, whether it's the ethereal sounds from Donkey Kong Country, or the driving music from Perfect Dark and Goldeneye. Anyway, I notice that some times, pop songs will remind me of old video games I've played, resulting in a Pavlovian response making me like said pop songs. 

Recently, [Write On Me](https://youtu.be/7WuggM1WBiU?t=1m4s) by Fifth Harmony came out, and while it's not typically my kind of sound, the production in the chorus, with its bouncy synths reminded me of [Bomberman 64's music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qg0x07oaZY), making me like the song for nostalgic reasons. I don't know, maybe they sound nothing alike to y'all, but I wonder if any of you have experienced the same situation?

TL;DR: Basically, I'm just wondering, does anyone ever hear pop songs that remind them of video games, or even other kinds of soundtracks (or anything else, I mean, I know sometimes I associate songs with memories)?

I haven't heard the album yet and I'd like to know everyone's opinions.

...


edit: OKAY I HAVE FINALLY BEEN BLESSED. Here's my track by track review (Warning, I'm really bad at explaining things/bad with words, so these reviews are gonna suck some major ass. I'm sorry):

**YOUR OPINION MAY DIFFER, BUT THIS REVIEW IS SOLELY MY OWN. I APOLOGIZE IF I OFFEND ANYONE.**

**Moonlight**: It sounds so sweet! This kind of music is nice to listen to when you want to work on something or when you want to go to sleep(?) lol, I promise I don't mean that as an insult. It's very soft and sweet. It kinda sounds like it belongs on her Christmas album. I like it. 8/10

**Dangerous Woman**: So I've listened to this song about a thousand times? Haha, I love it and I have since I first heard it. It's very powerful and sexy. I honestly don't know what to say because I think everyone on this sub has heard it so there's no point in me going in depth/describing the song. 8/10

**Be Alright**: Honestly, it's okay. I really like the first minute or so. That part is great and I'm obsessed with it! The problem is that it's just so repetitive! There's no need for it to be so long especially when it builds up to absolutely nothing. It kinda begins to feel like background music material. I will say, though, it actually reminds me of something Disclosure would produce (Like Omen or Willing and Able). I guess it's one of those songs you listen to when you're in the mood to dance/move around. Not a song you sit down and listen to because you like it so much. Too bad I don't dance. 4/10

**Into You**: Lol you guys already know this song exceeds the 1-10 scale. This song is perfection and I can say nothing more.

**Side to Side**: I love it! It has a nice Reggae feel which I love and it's very catchy/addictive. Has she ever come out with a song like this? She should totally do it more often haha. 8/10

**Let Me Love You**: It's so dark and sexy. I love how her voice skips during the chorus. The song really isn't that catchy/not something you really sing along with, but it's nice to listen to. It's also really chill. I'm honestly into more exciting/poppy songs, so this track didn't really do it for me. And I'm personally not a fan of Lil Wayne's rapping, so that kinda brought it down. But, I don't hate it. 5/10

**Greedy**: Woooo. Such a good song! It sounds like something a kpop group would release tbh. All the trumpets and guitars are giving me life and the catchy-ass beat is so... catchy. I love this song. I's so upbeat and so diva-ish. I love this damn song. 9.5/10 *Cause I am so*

**Leave Me Lonely**: I don't know what to say? It sounds nice and I like it, but I don't really know what I can say about it haha. I do feel like it fits the Dangerous Woman sound (The actual sound of the song, I don't know about the lyrics, I wasn't paying attention the them lol) 6/10

**Everyday**: Bleh. It's boring and I've never liked Future (Sorry!). It's close to being the worst song on the album. Honestly, a lot of these songs on the album may sound 'basic' or formulaic, but this one is easily the most basic. And I hate Future and his annoying ass voice saying 'Everyday' over and over again in the fucking chorus. 3/10

**Sometimes**: Again, I don't really know what to say about it... I like the lalalas. Those are catchy, I guess. The song is actually pretty decent. I think I'll warm up to it eventually, but for right now, it seems kind of... forgettable? 5/10

**I Don't Care**: Reminds me of her old music. It's more jazz inspired than the rest of the album, but I really like it. I could just lay back and chill while listening to this song. 7/10

**Bad Decisions**: ???? I was so hyped. Everyone loved this song. I guess I got my hopes up too high???? 4/10 I'll probably warm up to it, I guess :/

**Touch It**: Catchy (Lol how many times have I said that?) It's okay, just a bit lackluster. I love the harmonization, but I guess that can be said for the entire album. I'm getting tired, so the rest of these reviews are gonna suck more than they already do. XD 

**Knew Better/Forever Boy**: This track isn't even worth wasting time talking about 2/10

**Thinkin Bout You**: THEM VOCALS THO! That is all 6/10

Overall, I'd probably give the album a 7.5/10? I really like it! There were only two songs I didn't like which was great considering I usually hate every song on any album I listen to.

TL;DR: Ariana Grande is life (And so is Dangerous Woman!) If you liked those two then I'm sure you'll love the rest of the album as well, or at least most of it

**Artist background:**

&gt;[Frank Sinatra](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/bd/03/e3/bd03e34b4a0dd14e14363ad287e9a413.jpg) is probably the most influential popular music vocalist in history. The stiff-but-easy-going-down drink that is the voice of Old Blue Eyes is best paired with a side smoothest jazz and intoxicates more potently than even the strongest whiskey. Lady-killer, pussy-slayer, amazing vocalist, actor, first generation American, member of the [Rat Pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack), and the father of [this guy's](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Woody_Allen_-_Kup.JPG/800px-Woody_Allen_-_Kup.JPG) kid, Frank lived a full, successful life. 

&gt;His career spanned from [1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_of_Frank_Sinatra) all the way through [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Is_My_Lady), and he died in 1998 at the age of 83.

&gt;In case you don't still understand just how important Frank Sinatra was to pop music, before Frank Sinatra pop music barely existed. He revolutionized the way a person can flow on a track and ride a beat. He turned the voice into an instrument in the sphere of pop music. He made his voice just another trumpet or a sax in the pit with the band, albeit an exceptional one with a lot of solos. Frank was the first pop star.

&gt;There's a thing people say, where after DOOM, a 1994 video game heralded as the game which nearly invented the first-person shooter genre, was released, all other ""First-Person Shooters"" that came out after it were DOOM clones. They were just trying to replicate the success of DOOM. That was everyone after Frank Sinatra. 

&gt;It's not just Michael Buble who's a Frank Sinatra clone. Eddie Fischer is a Frank Sinatra clone. Michael Jackson is a Frank Sinatra clone. Marvin Gaye is a Frank Sinatra clone. John Mayer is a Frank Sinatra clone. Madonna is a Frank Sinatra clone. Adele is a Frank Sinatra clone. Taylor Swift is a Frank Sinatra clone.

&gt;Without Frank, pop music is different than it is today. Plain and simple. Nobody is more influential. Yes, he had a notable predecessor in Bing Crosby, but the point is moot when you consider the heights to which Frank propelled the art form.

**Album description:**

&gt;*In The Wee Small Hours* is considered by many to be the album which invented the concept album. The album is blue, it is lonely, it is introspective, it is depressive. It is ""mood indigo"". The concept begins at the album cover itself. Sinatra has a cigarette lit, sucking his troubles away, held lazily in his hand, his hat's on askew, he's looking down contemplatively, and the world, all around him, is blue. The world's lost definition; nothing is anything but varying shades of blue to our protagonist. 

&gt;There's no happiness. There's no ""let's go see what Spring is like on Jupiter and Mars"". There's no ""you make me feel like Spring has sprung"". There's no up-beat jazz drums and no peppy, belting trumpet sections. 

&gt;There's lots of euphoniums, flutes, sultry guitars, and harps. There's lots of crooning. There's lots of lamenting. There's lots of reminiscing.

&gt;The album was inspired in large part by his marital troubles with his second wife, [Ava Gardner](https://fabioferri.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ava-pinup.jpg) from whom he got a divorce two years after the release of ITWSH. I mean, did the man have some extramarital affairs going on? Yes. But who didn't in the 50s? And a part of the issues between he and Ava spawned from their mutual infidelity. In fact, she left him before the divorce happened, and certainly before this album was formulated. If you take the time and listen carefully, you can really get an impression of Frank's headspace in 1955. 

&gt;**You can time travel back to his mind in the KHJ Studios in Hollywood and you can feel the depression warmly and thickly envelope you as you let the blueness of the album enter you and surround you. Sorry for waxing so poetically about this thing but I'm afraid that you nerds will be scared of how old this thing is and won't listen to it so I've gotta sell it.**

&gt;The album was one of the first to be printed on a 12-inch vinyl LP, as if it wasn't already revolutionary enough. It was also sold in four smaller 45-rpm records sold in official cardboard sleeves, unlike the paper-sleeved single 45s of the time.

**Standout tracks:**

* [**""In The Wee Small Hours""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ImGP33hcc4) - Much like last week's *What's Going On*, this album's first track, the title track, is the treatise which sets the mood for the rest of it. Though here, it is not only a thematic mood, not only a sonic mood, but a literal mood. The first song makes you sad and you are sad from hereon out for approximately 49 minutes. And you'll love it.

* [**""It Never Entered My Mind""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijYzhQDUGYU) - The song which is most obviously about Frank's relationship with Ave (wondering what this is all about? read the album description that I put time and effort into, dork), ""It Never Entered"" is a relationship slowly slipping through your hands like sand. It's slowly sipping as you descend into depression and realize the magnitude of your situation. It's the ""okay, this might *actually* be happening"" moment, and it's beautiful.

* [**""Mood Indigo""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5fO-r2DwBY) - I don't know what to say about this song it's just good but I have to submit this thing cause it's late.

**Discussion:**

* First and foremost, what do you think of the album? What rating would you give it out of 10?

* Were you around when it was released? Reach inside your geriatric old brain and pull out what you thought of the thing at the time: has your opinion on the album changed?

* Have you heard the album before today? Have you listened to Frank Sinatra before today? If not, you should! We're discussing this album and this artist for a reason! (It's good!)

* What's your favorite song on the album

* What's your least favorite song on the album?

* How does this album hold up in the artist's discography?

* What should next week's Classic Album of the Week be? Keep in mind that, for the moment anyway, Classic Album of the Week is exclusively for pop albums that came out before 2000. There are many great albums that've come out in the new millennium worth discussing, but that's why we've got Throwback Thursday, quite frankly.

##**Carly Rae Jepsen’s** ***Emotion***  
**Try**: [Tiffany - Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyf33BuVtoM), [f(x) - When I’m Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRvF2ydxAEg)  
Tiffany is one of eight members of South Korea’s most successful girl group, Girls’ Generation. Talk is a track on her solo debut, and was written by London producer GRADES, and Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud! It's pretty much there for anyone who's craving anymore of the chugging bass and 80s synths of Carly's album. *Alternatively*, listen to f(x)’s When I’m Alone, which *is* a Carly Rae Jepsen song since she wrote it. This would happen to be *that* song that she sold off to Asia which is  about the thing that rhymes with contemplation.

##**Disclosure, AlunaGeorge**
**Try**: [f(x) - 4 Walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j7Umwfx60Q)  
4 Walls is not just one of the best k-pop songs of 2015, but one of the year's best pop songs, full stop. Its UK garage flavour can be attributed to the fact that it was produced by London duo, LDN Noise, but maintains girl group harmonies and a subtly weird double bridge that only k-pop manages to stick in. A natural partner song is [SHINee’s View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF53cptEE5k), written by same said Londoners, that leans towards deep house. Their respective parent albums delve into other EDM subgenres like piano house and Europop, for the interested (although admittedly nothing comes close to the joy of 4 Walls).

##**Justin Bieber's** ***Purpose***, **Nick Jonas**
**Try**: [BTS - Save Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZjt_sA2eso), [Block B - Toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtjxZoa_LHM)  
BTS is as close as k-pop gets to Justin Bieber in his post-Purpose era. Lots of hip-hop and EDM-inspired pop songs, often with drops instead of choruses, vague Diplo influences and so on. Their latest single, Save Me, sits somewhere between Where Are Ü Now’s explosiveness and What Do You Mean?’s tropical house vibe. Block B’s Toy is also a fairly chill pop song in a similar vein (and the video’s choreography includes dabbing).

##**Grimes, Beach House, Chairlift**
**Try**: [Neon Bunny - Romance in Seoul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfyc2YHj3zM), [Yukari - Marginal Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIUcaHkE60Q)  
If you enjoyed Grimes’ *Visions* and the cuts off of Art Angels like REALiTi or Butterfly, or stuff by the other aforementioned artists, either of these tracks might interest you. Both are pretty disparate artists from the whole mainstream k-pop scene and the lucrative idol industry, instead kinda serving up their own spins of dreampop from their bedrooms.  
**Deeper?** [Neon Bunny’s discography](https://neonbunny.bandcamp.com/), [Yukari’s *Echo (album)*](https://yukari.bandcamp.com/album/echo)

##**Fifth Harmony, Ariana Grande's ""Problem"", ""Focus""**
**Try**: [EXID - Ah Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egqDPipqIAg), [AOA - Good Luck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sno_genwMz8)  
For general new-gen girl groups in the vein of Fifth Harmony, EXID and AOA are both worth checking out. They pretty much are doing the same as in Western pop regarding those ridiculous brass hooks, and are just as (if not more) catchy and often more weird. You're not pressed to find more pop in this vein, just as it's not that hard to find in Western pop either. EXID, AOA, Sistar and so on are all groups doing stuff like that. For simplicity, I might as well just recommend the parent EPs that the singles come from.  
**Deeper?** [EXID’s *Ah Yeah (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxJAFgmdb_g), [AOA’s *Good Luck (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7LL1SlwKQ)

##**Rihanna, Drake, The Weeknd**
**Try**: [DEAN x ZICO - Pour Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpX6164uk4), [NCT U - The 7th Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA)  
Names like DEAN represent the vanguard of alternative R&amp;B in Korea (and all that trap influence), and share a lot of musical DNA with the biggest R&amp;B/pop hybrid acts at the moment (Rihanna, The Weeknd), and lots of the upcoming acts too (dvsn, Bryson Tiller). It's hard to ignore how similar to intro of DEAN's Pour Up is to Kendrick Lamar's Swimming Pools, although it quickly turns into a totally different seedy R&amp;B jam. *Alternatively*, try The 7th Sense, the debut track by the newest lucrative boy group, NCT U. Also, visuals and choreography tend to be intricately linked with songs, and the choreography to this track is actually phenomenal.

##**Britney Spears, Kesha**  
**Try**: [2NE1 - I Am The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o), [Girls’ Generation - Run Devil Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_gfD3nvh-8)  
2NE1's brand of pop is incessant and bursting with attitude. Their single, I Am The Best, threatens to sound dated, but with some of the most memorable hooks in k-pop history, it is rightfully an iconic pop song. *Alternatively*, the Girls Generation single, Run Devil Run, which was actually initially pitched to Kesha, who's recorded her own demo of it, matches the best of Western 00s electropop.   
**Deeper?** [f(x)'s *Pink Tape (album)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2LwR_D-sio), [2NE1's *2NE1 (2011 EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndNtjZ0YCr4)

##**Justin Timberlake's** ***Futurelove/Sexsounds***  
**Try**: [EXO - Lady Luck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C284fm3KCuQ), [Seungri - Strong Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDTsf5xw3Kg)  
Hell, EXO's Lady Luck does actually sound like Timbaland produced it. Its beatbox-laden instrumental with sampled acoustic guitars carries an NSYNC-esque melody until it randomly explodes into a drop punctuated with female moans. I think, once again, k-pop has the case where most of its 00s material just sounds like either Justin Timberlake (or NSYNC), or Boyz II Men. Still, slightly more recent material like the EXO single put modern spins on the formula.   
**Deeper?** [EXO's *EXODUS  (album)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAD5Gk6INCo), [f(x)'s *Red Light (album)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfuBmzd1tI)

##**Alessia Cara’s “Here”, Frank Ocean, Gallant**
**Try**: [Primary x Ohhyuk - Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq4dlD8h5dg), [Crush - woo ah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CM5iC_isug)  
For R&amp;B that leans more traditional, although is still in the alternative R&amp;B-sphere, the likes of Primary and Crush have been working in that area for a while. Lots of Rhodes electric keyboards, lots of jazz-inspired chord progressions and slightly wonky beats. Primary's Island is a certified slow slink of a song, while Crush's woo ah starts as lounge R&amp;B, but ends with a trap-influenced psychedelic coda.   
**Deeper?** [Primary’s &amp; Ohhyuk’s *Lucky You! (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcoUlL2aV7o&amp;list=PLfEa7qk1rCvYwlc5u_FAvfL3JAHAb6rkr), [Crush’s *Interlude (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PUzVOX9jsA&amp;list=PLb86fgrhn074MIADPpDsOlzdGoYwod0T6)

##**CHVRCHES, Purity Ring**
**Try**: [Lim Kim - Awoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXPADwU05OQ), [Tiffany - I Just Wanna Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Y3ABqK7M4)  
Also for fans of Lorde’s or Stromae’s style of songwriting, Lim Kim’s Awoo blew up on r/listentothis recently. Like Lorde or Stromae, the songwriting is relatively playful, but the production has more in common with CHVRCHES’ or Purity Ring’s shimmering synths. *Alternatively*, Tiffany’s I Just Wanna Dance goes heavy on 80s nostalgia, and a lot of the synths in it sound straight out of a CHVRCHES record.  
**Deeper?** [Casker’s *ground part 1 (album)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2NofPrm1Ic&amp;list=PLAv5NxX9RNotYXpbUYHMmwOuQfyYHCNPC), [Tiffany’s *I Just Wanna Dance (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjtDAA9Wr0E)

##**Skrillex, Diplo, Knife Party**
**Try**: [4Minute - Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY), [CL - Hello Bitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALj5MKjy2BU)  
Both Diplo and Skrillex have had their hands in k-pop (producing for acts like 4Minute and G-Dragon), and the rise of absolutely over-the-top trap-influenced k-pop monoliths with Frankenstein bridges and big drops inspired by exotic scales instead of choruses is absolutely their influence. Of course, this being k-pop, it’s at least twice as absurd. In general, it's the singles that bang hard, hence the further recommendations being singles, but an album worth mentioning would be G-Dragon's [*Coup D'Etat*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmVDQQnlLg4) with collaborations with Missy Elliot, Diplo, Baauer, Sky Ferreira and Boys Noize, making it an incredibly Western album.  
**Deeper?** [4Minute - Hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_F9HUTYnl0), [BTS - Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALj5MKjy2BU), [Big Bang - Bang Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ips2mM7Zqw)

##**Meghan Trainor's** ***Title***, **Lily Allen**
**Try**: [Lim Kim - Love Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlJXpjeYC8), [Akdong Musician - How People Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbc2yBheAbo)   
Apologies for blaspheming and mentioning Meghan Trainor's debut on r/popheads. Lim Kim's Awoo blew up, but the follow-up single, Love Game, trades in the Purity Ring chill for a more playful, lounge-inflected clapping chant. For retro-leaning jukebox pop, slightly quaint sibling duo Akdong Musician's single How People Move also certainly fits the bill. While a lot of their other material is more folky and singer-songwriter styled, they're not shy of random over-the-top oddities.  
**Deeper?** [Lim Kim's *Simple Mind (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhFMDAle8e4), [Akdong Musician's *Spring (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiKL-oj3bpo)

##**Jessie J's ""Bang Bang"", Little Mix, Christina Aguilera**  
**Try**: [Red Velvet - Dumb Dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0), [MAMAMOO - You’re The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbhmTM1cRro)  
If you're in it for upbeat pop without being too incessantly sugar-sweet, Red Velvet are probably the group doing it best in k-pop at the moment. Their concept is to flit between two categories of songs: energetic bangers, such as Dumb Dumb, or decidedly cooler R&amp;B swooning. Single, Dumb Dumb, is one of the most unbashedly fun pop songs of last year, recalling the best of Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj's Bang Bang, although it heads into far preppier, noisier territory with a chromatic bassline and detuned horns and an entire rap verse that literally just namechecks Michael Jackson songs for no reason (followed by a bridge that sounds like it's from a completely different song). *Alternatively*, MAMAMOO's single this year, You're The Best, is a horn-heavy Lady Marmalade-esque sort of song.

##**Lady Gaga's** ***The Fame***  
**Try**: [Super Junior - Sorry Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6QA3m58DQw), [BoA - Eat You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32LOWZhBp7Q)  
To be honest, half of all late 00s k-pop is just blaring electropop with ridiculous dance routines, and hair and outfits out of some lost sci-fi Justin Timberlake getup. For the rave synths present on Lady Gaga's *The Fame*, Super Junior's iconic single, Sorry Sorry (which has one of the most ridiculous dance routines amongst ridiculous dance routines), certainly satisfies that need.

##**Kimbra, Kylie Minogue's** ***Body Language***  
**Try**: [Ladies' Code - Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgT1eq3CLM), [Lim Kim - Love Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlJXpjeYC8)  
Ladies' Code's Galaxy is one of my favourite singles of 2016, and this is despite 2016 being an absolutely packed year for music so far (Beyoncé, Radiohead, James Blake, Ariana Grande, the list goes on). For those who enjoy the jazzy cool that folks like Kimbra and Kylie Minogue often breathe, it's absolutely worth a listen for its featherlight production and delicately shaped melody. Its last chorus adds in a great upright walking bassline, making it the preppiest thing I've heard this year.

##**Eurodisco**  
**Try**: [Orange Caramel - Catallena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Med2XipHJJM)  
A fan of cheesy eurodisco? Look no further, and simply take on some Orange Caramel songs. Their 2014 single, Catallena,  samples a Punjabi wedding song, setting it to Gloria Gaynor-esque disco. Also, the video is silly. Their songs also channel trot, the most traditional pop genre in Korea from the 1910s or so.

Its UK garage flavour can be attributed to the fact that it was produced by London duo, LDN Noise, but maintains girl group harmonies and a subtly weird double bridge that only k-pop manages to stick in. A natural partner song is [SHINee’s View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF53cptEE5k), written by same said Londoners, that leans towards deep house. Their respective parent albums delve into other EDM subgenres like piano house and Europop, for the interested (although admittedly nothing comes close to the joy of 4 Walls).

##**Justin Bieber's** ***Purpose***, **Nick Jonas**
**Try**: [BTS - Save Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZjt_sA2eso), [Block B - Toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtjxZoa_LHM)  
BTS is as close as k-pop gets to Justin Bieber in his post-Purpose era. Lots of hip-hop and EDM-inspired pop songs, often with drops instead of choruses, vague Diplo influences and so on. Their latest single, Save Me, sits somewhere between Where Are Ü Now’s explosiveness and What Do You Mean?’s tropical house vibe. Block B’s Toy is also a fairly chill pop song in a similar vein (and the video’s choreography includes dabbing).

**Try**: [Neon Bunny - Romance in Seoul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfyc2YHj3zM), [Yukari - Marginal Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIUcaHkE60Q)  
If you enjoyed Grimes’ *Visions* and the cuts off of Art Angels like REALiTi or Butterfly, or stuff by the other aforementioned artists, either of these tracks might interest you. Both are pretty disparate artists from the whole mainstream k-pop scene and the lucrative idol industry, instead kinda serving up their own spins of dreampop from their bedrooms.

**Try**: [EXID - Ah Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egqDPipqIAg), [AOA - Good Luck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sno_genwMz8)  
For general new-gen girl groups in the vein of Fifth Harmony, EXID and AOA are both worth checking out. They pretty much are doing the same as in Western pop regarding those ridiculous brass hooks, and are just as (if not more) catchy and often more weird. You're not pressed to find more pop in this vein, just as it's not that hard to find in Western pop either. EXID, AOA, Sistar and so on are all groups doing stuff like that. For simplicity, I might as well just recommend the parent EPs that the singles come from.

Names like DEAN represent the vanguard of alternative R&amp;B in Korea (and all that trap influence), and share a lot of musical DNA with the biggest R&amp;B/pop hybrid acts at the moment (Rihanna, The Weeknd), and lots of the upcoming acts too (dvsn, Bryson Tiller). It's hard to ignore how similar to intro of DEAN's Pour Up is to Kendrick Lamar's Swimming Pools, although it quickly turns into a totally different seedy R&amp;B jam. *Alternatively*, try The 7th Sense, the debut track by the newest lucrative boy group, NCT U. Also, visuals and choreography tend to be intricately linked with songs, and the choreography to this track is actually phenomenal.

2NE1's brand of pop is incessant and bursting with attitude. Their single, I Am The Best, threatens to sound dated, but with some of the most memorable hooks in k-pop history, it is rightfully an iconic pop song. *Alternatively*, the Girls Generation single, Run Devil Run, which was actually initially pitched to Kesha, who's recorded her own demo of it, matches the best of Western 00s electropop.

**Try**: [EXO - Lady Luck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C284fm3KCuQ), [Seungri - Strong Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDTsf5xw3Kg)  
Hell, EXO's Lady Luck does actually sound like Timbaland produced it. Its beatbox-laden instrumental with sampled acoustic guitars carries an NSYNC-esque melody until it randomly explodes into a drop punctuated with female moans. I think, once again, k-pop has the case where most of its 00s material just sounds like either Justin Timberlake (or NSYNC), or Boyz II Men. Still, slightly more recent material like the EXO single put modern spins on the formula.

**Try**: [Primary x Ohhyuk - Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq4dlD8h5dg), [Crush - woo ah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CM5iC_isug)  
For R&amp;B that leans more traditional, although is still in the alternative R&amp;B-sphere, the likes of Primary and Crush have been working in that area for a while. Lots of Rhodes electric keyboards, lots of jazz-inspired chord progressions and slightly wonky beats. Primary's Island is a certified slow slink of a song, while Crush's woo ah starts as lounge R&amp;B, but ends with a trap-influenced psychedelic coda.

##**CHVRCHES, Purity Ring**
**Try**: [Lim Kim - Awoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXPADwU05OQ), [Tiffany - I Just Wanna Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Y3ABqK7M4)  
Also for fans of Lorde’s or Stromae’s style of songwriting, Lim Kim’s Awoo blew up on r/listentothis recently. Like Lorde or Stromae, the songwriting is relatively playful, but the production has more in common with CHVRCHES’ or Purity Ring’s shimmering synths. *Alternatively*, Tiffany’s I Just Wanna Dance goes heavy on 80s nostalgia, and a lot of the synths in it sound straight out of a CHVRCHES record.

##**Skrillex, Diplo, Knife Party**
**Try**: [4Minute - Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY), [CL - Hello Bitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALj5MKjy2BU)  
Both Diplo and Skrillex have had their hands in k-pop (producing for acts like 4Minute and G-Dragon), and the rise of absolutely over-the-top trap-influenced k-pop monoliths with Frankenstein bridges and big drops inspired by exotic scales instead of choruses is absolutely their influence. Of course, this being k-pop, it’s at least twice as absurd. In general, it's the singles that bang hard, hence the further recommendations being singles, but an album worth mentioning would be G-Dragon's [*Coup D'Etat*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmVDQQnlLg4) with collaborations with Missy Elliot, Diplo, Baauer, Sky Ferreira and Boys Noize, making it an incredibly Western album.

##**Meghan Trainor's** ***Title***, **Lily Allen**
**Try**: [Lim Kim - Love Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlJXpjeYC8), [Akdong Musician - How People Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbc2yBheAbo)   
Apologies for blaspheming and mentioning Meghan Trainor's debut on r/popheads. Lim Kim's Awoo blew up, but the follow-up single, Love Game, trades in the Purity Ring chill for a more playful, lounge-inflected clapping chant. For retro-leaning jukebox pop, slightly quaint sibling duo Akdong Musician's single How People Move also certainly fits the bill. While a lot of their other material is more folky and singer-songwriter styled, they're not shy of random over-the-top oddities.

##**Jessie J's ""Bang Bang"", Little Mix, Christina Aguilera**  
**Try**: [Red Velvet - Dumb Dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0), [MAMAMOO - You’re The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbhmTM1cRro)  
If you're in it for upbeat pop without being too incessantly sugar-sweet, Red Velvet are probably the group doing it best in k-pop at the moment. Their concept is to flit between two categories of songs: energetic bangers, such as Dumb Dumb, or decidedly cooler R&amp;B swooning. Single, Dumb Dumb, is one of the most unbashedly fun pop songs of last year, recalling the best of Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj's Bang Bang, although it heads into far preppier, noisier territory with a chromatic bassline and detuned horns and an entire rap verse that literally just namechecks Michael Jackson songs for no reason (followed by a bridge that sounds like it's from a completely different song). *Alternatively*, MAMAMOO's single this year, You're The Best, is a horn-heavy Lady Marmalade-esque sort of song.

##**Lady Gaga's** ***The Fame***  
**Try**: [Super Junior - Sorry Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6QA3m58DQw), [BoA - Eat You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32LOWZhBp7Q)  
To be honest, half of all late 00s k-pop is just blaring electropop with ridiculous dance routines, and hair and outfits out of some lost sci-fi Justin Timberlake getup. For the rave synths present on Lady Gaga's *The Fame*, Super Junior's iconic single, Sorry Sorry (which has one of the most ridiculous dance routines amongst ridiculous dance routines), certainly satisfies that need.

##**Kimbra, Kylie Minogue's** ***Body Language***  
**Try**: [Ladies' Code - Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgT1eq3CLM), [Lim Kim - Love Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlJXpjeYC8)  
Ladies' Code's Galaxy is one of my favourite singles of 2016, and this is despite 2016 being an absolutely packed year for music so far (Beyoncé, Radiohead, James Blake, Ariana Grande, the list goes on). For those who enjoy the jazzy cool that folks like Kimbra and Kylie Minogue often breathe, it's absolutely worth a listen for its featherlight production and delicately shaped melody. Its last chorus adds in a great upright walking bassline, making it the preppiest thing I've heard this year.

##**Eurodisco**  
**Try**: [Orange Caramel - Catallena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Med2XipHJJM)  
A fan of cheesy eurodisco? Look no further, and simply take on some Orange Caramel songs. Their 2014 single, Catallena,  samples a Punjabi wedding song, setting it to Gloria Gaynor-esque disco. Also, the video is silly. Their songs also channel trot, the most traditional pop genre in Korea from the 1910s or so.

Beyond the idolatry and theatrics, k-pop is home to some of the most forward-thinking and plain fun pop songs. The language barrier can sometimes prove to be a challenge, but, often the sheer catchiness of some songs absolutely overcomes that. I thought I'd make a personal r/popheads recommendations list for those looking to maybe delve into k-pop, but don't know where to start, or what big singles are in at the moment. The general format I'm going to take is to take a Western point of comparison, one or two songs to try, and some places to go next if you're into what you heard. I've tried to keep things relatively recent, although there a few older gems in the list.

You may come out of this as a k-pop convert, maybe like a few songs, or just decide that k-pop isn't for you! Anything's good. Onwards we go.

Tiffany is one of eight members of South Korea’s most successful girl group, Girls’ Generation. Talk is a track on her solo debut, and was written by London producer GRADES, and Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud! It's pretty much there for anyone who's craving anymore of the chugging bass and 80s synths of Carly's album. *Alternatively*, listen to f(x)’s When I’m Alone, which *is* a Carly Rae Jepsen song since she wrote it. This would happen to be *that* song that she sold off to Asia which is  about the thing that rhymes with contemplation.

Like Lorde or Stromae, the songwriting is relatively playful, but the production has more in common with CHVRCHES’ or Purity Ring’s shimmering synths. *Alternatively*, Tiffany’s I Just Wanna Dance goes heavy on 80s nostalgia, and a lot of the synths in it sound straight out of a CHVRCHES record.

##**Skrillex, Diplo, Knife Party**
**Try**: [4Minute - Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY), [CL - Hello Bitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALj5MKjy2BU)  
Both Diplo and Skrillex have had their hands in k-pop (producing for acts like 4Minute and G-Dragon), and the rise of absolutely over-the-top trap-influenced k-pop monoliths with Frankenstein bridges and big drops inspired by exotic scales instead of choruses is absolutely their influence. Of course, this being k-pop, it’s at least twice as absurd. In general, it's the singles that bang hard, hence the further recommendations being singles, but an album worth mentioning would be G-Dragon's [*Coup D'Etat*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmVDQQnlLg4) with collaborations with Missy Elliot, Diplo, Baauer, Sky Ferreira and Boys Noize, making it an incredibly Western album.

##**Meghan Trainor's** ***Title***, **Lily Allen**
**Try**: [Lim Kim - Love Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlJXpjeYC8), [Akdong Musician - How People Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbc2yBheAbo)   
Apologies for blaspheming and mentioning Meghan Trainor's debut on r/popheads. Lim Kim's Awoo blew up, but the follow-up single, Love Game, trades in the Purity Ring chill for a more playful, lounge-inflected clapping chant. For retro-leaning jukebox pop, slightly quaint sibling duo Akdong Musician's single How People Move also certainly fits the bill. While a lot of their other material is more folky and singer-songwriter styled, they're not shy of random over-the-top oddities.  
**Deeper?** [Lim Kim's *Simple Mind (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhFMDAle8e4), [Akdong Musician's *Spring (EP)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiKL-oj3bpo)

##**Jessie J's ""Bang Bang"", Little Mix, Christina Aguilera**  
**Try**: [Red Velvet - Dumb Dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0), [MAMAMOO - You’re The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbhmTM1cRro)  
If you're in it for upbeat pop without being too incessantly sugar-sweet, Red Velvet are probably the group doing it best in k-pop at the moment. Their concept is to flit between two categories of songs: energetic bangers, such as Dumb Dumb, or decidedly cooler R&amp;B swooning. Single, Dumb Dumb, is one of the most unbashedly fun pop songs of last year, recalling the best of Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj's Bang Bang, although it heads into far preppier, noisier territory with a chromatic bassline and detuned horns and an entire rap verse that literally just namechecks Michael Jackson songs for no reason (followed by a bridge that sounds like it's from a completely different song). *Alternatively*, MAMAMOO's single this year, You're The Best, is a horn-heavy Lady Marmalade-esque sort of song.

##**Lady Gaga's** ***The Fame***  
**Try**: [Super Junior - Sorry Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6QA3m58DQw), [BoA - Eat You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32LOWZhBp7Q)  
To be honest, half of all late 00s k-pop is just blaring electropop with ridiculous dance routines, and hair and outfits out of some lost sci-fi Justin Timberlake getup. For the rave synths present on Lady Gaga's *The Fame*, Super Junior's iconic single, Sorry Sorry (which has one of the most ridiculous dance routines amongst ridiculous dance routines), certainly satisfies that need.

##**Kimbra, Kylie Minogue's** ***Body Language***  
**Try**: [Ladies' Code - Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgT1eq3CLM), [Lim Kim - Love Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlJXpjeYC8)  
Ladies' Code's Galaxy is one of my favourite singles of 2016, and this is despite 2016 being an absolutely packed year for music so far (Beyoncé, Radiohead, James Blake, Ariana Grande, the list goes on). For those who enjoy the jazzy cool that folks like Kimbra and Kylie Minogue often breathe, it's absolutely worth a listen for its featherlight production and delicately shaped melody. Its last chorus adds in a great upright walking bassline, making it the preppiest thing I've heard this year.

##**Eurodisco**  
**Try**: [Orange Caramel - Catallena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Med2XipHJJM)  
A fan of cheesy eurodisco? Look no further, and simply take on some Orange Caramel songs. Their 2014 single, Catallena,  samples a Punjabi wedding song, setting it to Gloria Gaynor-esque disco. Also, the video is silly. Their songs also channel trot, the most traditional pop genre in Korea from the 1910s or so.

 if you like aesthetically produced hip-hop albums (think **Anderson Paak**, check out **Mick Jenkins**. his album ""The Water[s]"" is exceptional, and criminally overlooked. the fact that he was left off of the XXL Freshman list is a punishable offense, imo. he's going places. [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIbfNuYhCVE)

if you like alternative music with hints of pop- **Saint Motel** mostly- check out **Joywave**. their songs range from airy and light to dark and heavy, all within the span of one album- 2015's ""How Do You Feel Now?"". their song ""Tongues"" broke the bottom of the Hot 100, if i remember correctly, but all their stuff deserves a good listen to. it's definitely pop at its core, under all the alternative exterior. [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn3Mz6KT5c)

if you like soulful R&amp;B with an experimental tone, like **Frank Ocean**'s ""Swim Good"", check out **Chet Faker**. dude's been making solid songs for a long time, all of which sounding sultry yet creative at the same time. he mixes R&amp;B with jazz with pop, all at the same time. [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhpc8UIA1BE)

if you feel like **summer music**, **Caravela**'s your band. it's indie, but sounds like summer feels. its up-tempo and bright, giving the impression of driving a car with the windows down. it makes me feel good, i know that much. perfect for nice, hot days and chilling at the beach. [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTAMB4ODGy4)

if you haven't listened to **Beck's new song ""Wow""** lately, wyd. get on that. it's different than what he's done- as with everything Beck makes- but it's so catchy and it grows on you. maybe you won't feel it by the first listen, but over time you'll find yourself coming back to it.

**Artist background**

[Björk](http://www.bjork.fr/local/cache-vignettes/L298xH377/040828_Bjork_newsweek-a9b92.jpg) is an Icelandic singer, producer and songwriter. She's one of the most inventive music figures of recent memory, with forward thinking production and an instantly identifiable voice. Her career started out at the very young age of 12 when she released her first official album. As a young adult, Björk was involved in many short-lived bands, but it was only until the late 80s that she saw success beyond Iceland, when she joined a band called The Sugarcubes as the lead singer. The band put out three albums before eventually disbanding in 1992. Soon after, Björk moved to London and began to embark on a solo career, releasing her debut album *Debut* the following year. *Debut* was met with critical acclaim for its unique songwriting, danceable grooves and of course, Björk's emotive and one-of-a-kind voice. The album spawned hits such as ""Human Nature"", ""Venus As A Boy"" and ""Big Time Sensuality"". *Debut* was a big success internationally, most notably within the United States and the U.K. In 1995, Björk had returned with her second album *Post*. On this album, she continued to develop upon the things that made *Debut* such a success, this time with more experimental and adventurous production. Just like the last album, *Post* saw critical and commercial success, landing on many music publication year-end lists and spawning some of the biggest songs of her career to date. With each record, Björk changes up her artistic palette, from the glitchy beats and orchestral melodrama of Homogenic, to the very intimate and immaculate subtlety of Vespertine, to the very minimal and vocal driven Medulla, to the abrasive industrialism of Volta, to the earthy and visually driven Biophilia and most recently, the compelling, devastating and incredibly personal Vulnicura, which was released last year. With each album, Björk proves that she's is capable of re-inventing herself and exploring new and innovative ideas, which has lead to her being hailed as an influential figure within both pop and electronic music.

**Artist Background**

Throughout the decades, Björk's has ventured across many genres and styles, but she's considers herself to be a pop artist, and it shows in her music, which has always been eclectic and left-field, but has still maintained a sensibility deeply rooted within pop music, and this is best shown on *Post*. Stylistically, it is incredibly varied and diverse. There's something there for everyone, borrowing from styles such as house, jazz, ambient and trip hop. With all of these different styles present on the album, there always remains one element that brings everything together cohesively: Björk's vocals. As expected from a Björk album, her distinct vocals are incredibly expressive with a large range, in terms of both pitch and timbre. There are moments when she's quietly cooing (Headphones), moments when she's singing her heart out (The Modern Things) and even moments when she's doing both (It's Oh So Quiet).

___

**Standout Tracks**

* [Army Of Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KxtgS2lU94)

Starting off *Post* with arguably its most well known hit, Army Of Me deserves the honourable title of ""irritable banger"" for many reasons. Over heavy industrial instrumentation, most notably that repetitive saw wave bassline, Björk is upfront, direct and taking no prisoners when she urges the listener to get a grip of themselves. Although she sounds pissed off and the song is presented in an aggressive way, ""Army Of Me"" could very well be seen as a motivational slap in the face encouraging independence and self-reliance.

* [Hyperballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26sP2WsA5cY)

""Hyperballad"" is generally considered to be Björk's signature song. Sonically it's got a very peaceful and spacious sound to it, with the skittering drum patterns which get louder and more layered in the back half, the warm melody and the energetic synth in the chorus. This was the first glimpse of a style that she'd develop upon on subsequent albums, most notably Vespertine. Lyrically, the song tells a story which takes a turn into pretty morbid territory. It starts off with Björk describing a unique interest that she's found in throwing objects off a steep cliff, but soon after she starts to get ideas about throwing herself off the cliff. It's definitely one of those ""two-faced"" songs where the instrumentation is inversely related to the lyrics, much like ""Pumped Up Kicks"" by Foster the People or ""Little Secrets"" by Passion Pit.

* [It's Oh So Quiet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF9TjbdJyUE)

If you ever needed an example of Björk's versatility not just as a musician, but as a vocalist, then this song is for you. She goes full jazz on this track, covering the Betty Hutton classic of the same name and completely owning it as if she wrote it herself. Björk sounds absolutely bombastic and confident and it sounds like she's having a great time doing so.

**Discussion**

* First and foremost, what do you think of the album? What rating would you give it out of 10?

* Were you around when it was released? Reach inside your geriatric old brain and pull out what you thought of the thing at the time: has your opinion on the album changed?

* Have you heard the album before today? Have you listened to Björk! before today? If not, you should! We're discussing this album and this artist for a reason! (It's good! They're good!!)

* What's your favourite song on the album?

* What's your least favourite song on the album?

* How does this album hold up in the artist's discography?

**Artist background**

[Björk](http://www.bjork.fr/local/cache-vignettes/L298xH377/040828_Bjork_newsweek-a9b92.jpg) is an Icelandic singer, producer and songwriter. She's one of the most inventive music figures of recent memory, with forward thinking production and an instantly identifiable voice. Her career started out at the very young age of 12 when she released her first official album. As a young adult, Björk was involved in many short-lived bands, but it was only until the late 80s that she saw success beyond Iceland, when she joined a band called The Sugarcubes as the lead singer. The band put out three albums before eventually disbanding in 1992. Soon after, Björk moved to London and began to embark on a solo career, releasing her debut album *Debut* the following year. *Debut* was met with critical acclaim for its unique songwriting, danceable grooves and of course, Björk's emotive and one-of-a-kind voice. The album spawned hits such as ""Human Nature"", ""Venus As A Boy"" and ""Big Time Sensuality"". *Debut* was a big success internationally, most notably within the United States and the U.K. In 1995, Björk had returned with her second album *Post*. On this album, she continued to develop upon the things that made *Debut* such a success, this time with more experimental and adventurous production. Just like the last album, *Post* saw critical and commercial success, landing on many music publication year-end lists and spawning some of the biggest songs of her career to date. With each record, Björk changes up her artistic palette, from the glitchy beats and orchestral melodrama of Homogenic, to the very intimate and immaculate subtlety of Vespertine, to the very minimal and vocal driven Medulla, to the abrasive industrialism of Volta, to the earthy and visually driven Biophilia and most recently, the compelling, devastating and incredibly personal Vulnicura, which was released last year. With each album, Björk proves that she's is capable of re-inventing herself and exploring new and innovative ideas, which has lead to her being hailed as an influential figure within both pop and electronic music.

**Artist Background**

Throughout the decades, Björk's has ventured across many genres and styles, but she's considers herself to be a pop artist, and it shows in her music, which has always been eclectic and left-field, but has still maintained a sensibility deeply rooted within pop music, and this is best shown on *Post*. Stylistically, it is incredibly varied and diverse. There's something there for everyone, borrowing from styles such as house, jazz, ambient and trip hop. With all of these different styles present on the album, there always remains one element that brings everything together cohesively: Björk's vocals. As expected from a Björk album, her distinct vocals are incredibly expressive with a large range, in terms of both pitch and timbre. There are moments when she's quietly cooing (Headphones), moments when she's singing her heart out (The Modern Things) and even moments when she's doing both (It's Oh So Quiet).

___

**Standout Tracks**

* [Army Of Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KxtgS2lU94)

Starting off *Post* with arguably its most well known hit, Army Of Me deserves the honourable title of ""irritable banger"" for many reasons. Over heavy industrial instrumentation, most notably that repetitive saw wave bassline, Björk is upfront, direct and taking no prisoners when she urges the listener to get a grip of themselves. Although she sounds pissed off and the song is presented in an aggressive way, ""Army Of Me"" could very well be seen as a motivational slap in the face encouraging independence and self-reliance.

* [Hyperballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26sP2WsA5cY)

""Hyperballad"" is generally considered to be Björk's signature song. Sonically it's got a very peaceful and spacious sound to it, with the skittering drum patterns which get louder and more layered in the back half, the warm melody and the energetic synth in the chorus. This was the first glimpse of a style that she'd develop upon on subsequent albums, most notably Vespertine. Lyrically, the song tells a story which takes a turn into pretty morbid territory. It starts off with Björk describing a unique interest that she's found in throwing objects off a steep cliff, but soon after she starts to get ideas about throwing herself off the cliff. It's definitely one of those ""two-faced"" songs where the instrumentation is inversely related to the lyrics, much like ""Pumped Up Kicks"" by Foster the People or ""Little Secrets"" by Passion Pit.

* [It's Oh So Quiet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF9TjbdJyUE)

If you ever needed an example of Björk's versatility not just as a musician, but as a vocalist, then this song is for you. She goes full jazz on this track, covering the Betty Hutton classic of the same name and completely owning it as if she wrote it herself. Björk sounds absolutely bombastic and confident and it sounds like she's having a great time doing so.

[Let's discuss the mainstream's first introduction to Abel Tesfaye, also known as ""The Weeknd""](https://youtu.be/o9PuAm7d0PA).

This crooner's approach to music was one of the first steps into R&amp;B's shift into the moody, dark, and hedonistic tendencies, which would later be explored by big names such as [Usher](https://youtu.be/nNTyfVh3nmU) and [Drake](https://youtu.be/Fpw8ylGdCkQ), as well as inspiring other upcoming Canadian artists to follow suit, like [PARTYNEXTDOOR](https://youtu.be/WsPfSXJaelk), [Tory Lanez](https://youtu.be/HLbiWyqjMA4), and [Bryson Tiller](https://youtu.be/U4MHrrIQuis). The Weeknd's first release, *House of Balloons*, came out on March 21st, 2011, and there had been nothing like it prior to its release. R&amp;B at the time surrounding *Balloons*'s release, while usually [*very*](https://youtu.be/_zI3OeNsnvI) [*sexual*](https://youtu.be/8s2_QLjF2Vs) [in](https://youtu.be/s1XozsBN5Z4) [nature](https://youtu.be/HhuGQUZJot8), rarely involved any sort of drugs or other illicit behavior, but The Weeknd went full throttle into the life of sex, drugs, and ~~rock'n'roll~~ nihilistic hedonism. Take a glimpse into the first set of lyrics in this song:

&gt;*I left my girl back home*

&gt;*I don't love her no more*

&gt;*And she'll never fucking know that*

&gt;*These fucking eyes that I'm staring at*

Off the bat we've already got this depiction of a man who doesn't regret cheating on his girlfriend because their love has died. He's fine with having sex with somebody else (Are they strangers? Does the girl the man has fallen out of love with know that he's cheating? Does the girl he's cheating on her with know he's cheating? The mystery adds to the song.) because their relationship is broken. Onto the hook:

&gt;*Bring your love baby I could bring my shame*

&gt;*Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain*

Is he expressing regret? Is his shame cheating on his girlfriend, or is his shame staying in his godforsaken relationship? Him and his newfound lover are trying to ease their respective pains with drugs, something rarely mentioned in prior R&amp;B music but seems to be dominating [even](https://youtu.be/tt2aYh6D7cU) [current](https://youtu.be/4mu_wGH8MvI) [pop](https://youtu.be/foE1mO2yM04) [trends](https://youtu.be/oh2LWWORoiM) for the first time since Nirvana was big. Was this triggered by The Weeknd's success? I can't say it with 100% certainty but I believe so.

The Weeknd is a gifted songwriter who not only went on to dominate streaming services and radio stations for the past two years, but also managed to guide trends within pop, R&amp;B, and even hip-hop to an extent.

**Introduction:**

Madonna's best-selling album to date, and one of the best-selling albums ever, turns 30 today. Reaching #1 on the charts and outselling her second biggest album by over 4 million, it's a true milestone for the Queen of Pop. It was Madonna's third studio album, and a classic for Madonna fans and popheads alike.

**Standout Tracks:**

&gt; [**Papa Don't Preach**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G333Is7VPOg)

&gt; Madonna's fourth #1 Billboard single, is one of the biggest classics in her discography. It's a brilliant blend of pop and classical production, and works really well. Fun fact, the song is based on high school gossip that one of the writers heard outside his Hollywood studio, where girls would congregate.

-

&gt; [**Open Your Heart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snsTmi9N9Gs)

&gt; Her fifth #1 Billboard single. Open Your Heart is one of the more romantic songs of Madonna's 80s era. Fitting with the iconic style of the entire album, Open Your Heart also blends classical and pop. That can't be said for the next iconic single, however...

-

&gt; [**La Isla Bonita**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YzW1nMB9fk)

&gt; No Madonna fan would dare deny the brilliance of this iconic song. First offered to Michael Jackson, the Latino-inspired tribute was one of its kind. The Spanish flamenco style reappeared in Who's That Girl, and numerous Spanish covers. [Alizée also did a popular cover.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyM7sw4lVSk)

---

In just 10 songs, the album has all genres. Emotional ballads such as Live To Tell, dance bangers like Where's The Party and Love Makes The World Go Round, and the Spanish-inspired La Isla Bonita.

Without a doubt, True Blue made Madonna's 80s sound iconic for her, and is one of the reasons she's so well known for her 80s catalogue. To start off, I'll delve into the first single - Live To Tell. It's the only big emotional ballad on the album. Her controversial but amazing live rendition of it in 2006, where she performed on a cross whilst wearing a crown of thorns, is one of her most iconic performances to date. Italian religious groups considered it an 'act of hostility' towards the Roman Catholic Church when she performed it in Rome. Lyrically, it's one of Madonna's best moments.

**Iconic performance:** [Confessions Tour, 2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JvK3U2gpsQ)

After Live To Tell created hype for M's third studio album, Papa Don't Preach exploded. One of Madonna's biggest singles, I couldn't find anything to flaw with this song if you asked me. It's catchy, has great production, and corny lyrics. For an 80s pop sensation, the song surprisingly boasts a runtime of over 5 minutes, too. 


**Iconic performance:** [Blonde Ambition Tour, 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t4GQcQi1xA)

The title track, True Blue, is fun, romantic, and glitzy. It's the stereotypical chessy 80s boy-meets-girl love song. Featuring doo-wop chord progressions, the song harks back to even earlier eras than the 80s (yes, they exist!) - as does the accompanying music video. Everything about the song and video is brilliantly cheesy.

**Iconic performance:** [Rebel Heart Tour, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByyfjet3go)

Originally written for Cyndi Lauper, the live performances of Open Your Heart are where Madonna's infamous conical bras were first used. The video pays homage to Liza Minelli and Marlene Dietrich, which is a nice piece of Madonna trivia. Much like many other songs on the album, it's a typical love song that combines elements of classical and pop music.

**Iconic performance:** [Grammys 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvHNBOXFe2w)

La Isla Bonita, for me, is the one standout track out of them all. La Isla Bonita is one of the early Madonna songs that shows her evolving as a singer. Madonna continued to use Latino inspired elements in Who's That Girl, after noticing the popularity of La Isla Bonita. Cuban drums, Spanish guitars, harmonicas, and maracas give the song an authentic Latin feel. Madonna references San Pedro, which some speculate to be a Caribbean island in Belize.

**Iconic performance:** [Live Earth 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbDbBal53ig)

Non-singles include:

* **White Heat**
 
 A nice, danceable track, but some say that it's the weakest song on the album.


* **Where's The Party**

 One of the most dance-y songs on the album, and was included on the dance compilation You Can Dance. 

* **Jimmy Jimmy**

 Possibly the song that has aged the worse - but it's still a fun, short, track with funny lyrics.

* **Love Makes The World Go Round**

 Rounds off the album with a song similar to White Heat. Quite danceable, but not all that memorable. She performed it at her Live Aid performance in 1985.

Reaching #1 on the charts and outselling her second biggest album by over 4 million, it's a true milestone for the Queen of Pop. It was Madonna's third studio album, and a classic for Madonna fans and popheads alike.

**Standout Tracks:**

&gt; [**Papa Don't Preach**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G333Is7VPOg)

&gt; Madonna's fourth #1 Billboard single, is one of the biggest classics in her discography. It's a brilliant blend of pop and classical production, and works really well. Fun fact, the song is based on high school gossip that one of the writers heard outside his Hollywood studio, where girls would congregate.

&gt; [**Open Your Heart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snsTmi9N9Gs)

&gt; Her fifth #1 Billboard single. Open Your Heart is one of the more romantic songs of Madonna's 80s era. Fitting with the iconic style of the entire album, Open Your Heart also blends classical and pop. That can't be said for the next iconic single, however...

-

&gt; [**La Isla Bonita**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YzW1nMB9fk)

&gt; No Madonna fan would dare deny the brilliance of this iconic song. First offered to Michael Jackson, the Latino-inspired tribute was one of its kind. The Spanish flamenco style reappeared in Who's That Girl, and numerous Spanish covers. [Alizée also did a popular cover.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyM7sw4lVSk)

In just 10 songs, the album has all genres. Emotional ballads such as Live To Tell, dance bangers like Where's The Party and Love Makes The World Go Round, and the Spanish-inspired La Isla Bonita.

Without a doubt, True Blue made Madonna's 80s sound iconic for her, and is one of the reasons she's so well known for her 80s catalogue. To start off, I'll delve into the first single - Live To Tell. It's the only big emotional ballad on the album. Her controversial but amazing live rendition of it in 2006, where she performed on a cross whilst wearing a crown of thorns, is one of her most iconic performances to date. Italian religious groups considered it an 'act of hostility' towards the Roman Catholic Church when she performed it in Rome. Lyrically, it's one of Madonna's best moments.

**Iconic performance:** [Confessions Tour, 2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JvK3U2gpsQ)

After Live To Tell created hype for M's third studio album, Papa Don't Preach exploded. One of Madonna's biggest singles, I couldn't find anything to flaw with this song if you asked me. It's catchy, has great production, and corny lyrics. For an 80s pop sensation, the song surprisingly boasts a runtime of over 5 minutes, too. 


**Iconic performance:** [Blonde Ambition Tour, 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t4GQcQi1xA)

The title track, True Blue, is fun, romantic, and glitzy. It's the stereotypical chessy 80s boy-meets-girl love song. Featuring doo-wop chord progressions, the song harks back to even earlier eras than the 80s (yes, they exist!) - as does the accompanying music video. Everything about the song and video is brilliantly cheesy.

**Iconic performance:** [Rebel Heart Tour, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByyfjet3go)

Originally written for Cyndi Lauper, the live performances of Open Your Heart are where Madonna's infamous conical bras were first used. The video pays homage to Liza Minelli and Marlene Dietrich, which is a nice piece of Madonna trivia. Much like many other songs on the album, it's a typical love song that combines elements of classical and pop music.

**Iconic performance:** [Grammys 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvHNBOXFe2w)

La Isla Bonita, for me, is the one standout track out of them all. La Isla Bonita is one of the early Madonna songs that shows her evolving as a singer. Madonna continued to use Latino inspired elements in Who's That Girl, after noticing the popularity of La Isla Bonita. Cuban drums, Spanish guitars, harmonicas, and maracas give the song an authentic Latin feel. Madonna references San Pedro, which some speculate to be a Caribbean island in Belize.

**Iconic performance:** [Live Earth 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbDbBal53ig)

Non-singles include:

* **White Heat**
 
 A nice, danceable track, but some say that it's the weakest song on the album.


* **Where's The Party**

 One of the most dance-y songs on the album, and was included on the dance compilation You Can Dance. 

* **Jimmy Jimmy**

 Possibly the song that has aged the worse - but it's still a fun, short, track with funny lyrics.

* **Love Makes The World Go Round**

 Rounds off the album with a song similar to White Heat. Quite danceable, but not all that memorable. She performed it at her Live Aid performance in 1985.

***

In this thread, lets try to draw some direct connections between songs that have influenced other songs. As we (/u/-dolantello- and myself) try to draw attention to in the Classic Pop Album of the Week threads, pop music is constantly building on itself and drawing from its history. As a result, each new generation of pop music carries with it the unique marks of generations gone by.

Let's take a look at a few:

In your comments to this thread, **include two songs: The Father, the song that creates the influence, and the Son, the song that has been influenced by the Father.** For bonus points (and to avoid this thread being stupidly recency biased), maintain at least a 10-year gap between your songs.

**Please discuss what you think the influence is between the two songs instead of just listing them**, as well as why you think the influence is cool, interesting, or worth mentioning.

For bonus bonus points, avoid people who are obvious clones of past great pop musicians. That's pretty much cheating. 

For a **TL;DR**, just read the bolded parts. Father: Daft Punk - Something About Us (2001)

Son: Kavinsky - Night Call (2011)

Anyone who understands electronic music on even the slightest level, knows that daft punk influences everyone, but this particular example is very subtle in it's approach, yet almost screams ""hey daft punk, this is for you dad's!"". 

""Something About Us"" was driven by it's funky bass groove. and every other melody was built around that to add fullness to the overall song. the entire vibe of the track creates a night time atmosphere. from the hazy, psychedelic electric guitars, to the slow, seductive tempo and robotic vocals sounding as if they're being whispered and sang at the exact same time! you could almost classify daft punk's track as R&amp;B or at least an extension of the genre in a more electronic direction. people could argue that Zapp &amp; Roger influenced daft punk, but in this particular instance, daft punk abandoned their typical upbeat, dance party vibes for a more dark, and slightly romantic, yet creepy, electronic love ballad. the production on this track was a mixture of electronic and live instruments to create a really vintage ""funk band"" quality and i think that added to the aesthetic of the track. i mean, it's meant to give you the feeling of being in a hazy club listening to a funk band play the last song as you prepare to go home at 3 am. (or that's how i feel when i listen to it)

Fast forward 10 years later and Kavinsky creates his own exotic sounding night time banger with almost the exact same formula, including the heavily distorted and breathy robotic vocals. aside from the songs title ""Night Call"", the vibe of the song sets the atmosphere of a night drive through the back roads while thinking of your lover. ""Night Call"" takes the dark, melodic vibes that were in daft punk's track and drags them deeper into darkness, all the while maintaining that sweet, catchy groove. it's a love song, just like daft punk's track, but it has a more resistant quality to it. as if the love is forbidden. Kavinsky's production isn't as live sounding, outside of the snare drum. but even with the very evident digital sound quality of the track, it captures the essence of the original daft punk track with is sweeping slow melodies.

both tracks were highly successful singles and proved to be huge points in both artists careers. daft punk returned to that slow funky groove sound with their album R.A.M and i believe Kavinsky produced with Kanye West a few times, adding his very heavy digital sound to hiphop music. 

to me, there wouldn't have been a ""Night Call"" if there wasn't a ""Something About Us"" first. the daft punk track seemed to literally open the doors, and people's ears, to wanting to hear more dark electronic driven ""love"" songs, especially one's that resulted in this much success.",Something About Us,Daft Punk,77.7777777777777,80.0,"['funky bass groove', 'night time atmosphere', 'hazy, psychedelic electric guitars', 'slow, seductive tempo', 'robotic vocals', 'electronic and live instruments', 'vintage funk band quality', 'heavily distorted and breathy robotic vocals', 'dark, melodic vibes', 'sweet, catchy groove', 'digital sound quality', 'sweeping slow melodies']","['Daft Punk influences everyone in electronic music', 'Zapp & Roger influenced Daft Punk', 'Something About Us influences Night Call', 'Daft Punk returned to slow funky groove with R.A.M', 'Kavinsky worked with Kanye West, adding digital sound to hip-hop']","['being in a hazy club listening to a funk band play the last song at 3 am', 'night drive through the back roads while thinking of your lover']","['dark and slightly romantic', 'creepy, electronic love ballad', 'feeling of being in a hazy club', 'exotic sounding night time banger', 'love song with a resistant quality', 'love is forbidden']",,"['Daft Punk - Something About Us (2001)', 'Kavinsky - Night Call (2011)', 'Daft Punk mixed electronic and live instruments for a vintage sound', 'Kavinsky used digital sound production']","[{'song': 'Something About Us', 'artist': 'Daft Punk'}, {'song': 'Night Call', 'artist': 'Kavinsky'}]","This music features a funky bass groove, hazy psychedelic electric guitars, and a slow, seductive tempo, combining electronic and live instruments for a vintage funk band quality.

The way George Clinton uses the chorus is revolutionary. Read this please it's important to me thanks love you. [ANALYSIS OF MOTHERSHIP CONNECTION BY PARLIAMENT. PLEASE READ. MODS TAG AS IMPORTANTE POR FAVOR.) I've been listening to a lot of parliament recently and yeah so possible drunkess might be involved in this situation but is that really relevant? I say no.

So Parliament is a group that saught to combine funk, soul, and pop music in a way that brought the outrageous creativity that George clinton had demonstrated through the Funkadelic group, yknow? That's what i'm saying. Yes. So this combination of funk, soul, and pop was fantastic. Sorry if I get a little distracted I'm watching RedLetteRMedia's review of iron man 3 righ tnow and its pretty good so sorry if this is a little scatter brained but i like to give it to you guys raw yknow ok ok kok

So here's why Parliament is important to pop music and i wanna know what you guys think of these ideas please like share and subrscribe and leave a comment below letting me know your thohgts on the topics brought up in this thread OP by yours truly dicatrium the one man masterpiece.

So like Parliament's integration of the call and response chorus and the way they wove it into their music is no better demonstrated than on their magnum opus of an album, *Mothership Connection*. I think there's a user on this forum named mothershipconnection. good looks to you my dude. you've got a cool ass name.

So on Mothership Connection, basically every single song is all chorus apart from the little interludish skits that carry the song along as the aliens and the radio host of WEFUNK (that's ""we funk"") give us context to the concept we're speaking on in this album. The most interesting thing to me about the choruses in *Mothership Connection* is how nonlinear they are, yknow? Like Before i listened to this fucking shit, this fucking shit right here, I had never heard somebody use like foreshadowing with a chorus. Like this dude, this george clinton dude, he'll act like he's just talking, like hes' just talking normal fucking shit right. like he's just there chilling at the microphone and talking to his band and hes like ""hey guys did you know that we swing low sweet chariot stop and let me ride?"" like he's just being casual and then in a minute or so that becomes the next chorus that the group is singing.

the experience in crazy, honestly. i think the use of the chorus and the call-and-response framework that Parliament uses on so many of their records is absolutely revolutionary and I think it affects how we look at the chorus today to be honest. the way they did it, it was like the chorus didn't need to be some cheesy shit that was repeated in a way that grabbed the ears of people in radio land.

the chorus could be whatever the fuckk you wanted, repeated over and over again, and you could change the chorus several times in a song and it can still come off as pop. like they managed to make fucking concept albums about defeating a space pimp with the power of funk, raising atlantis from the ocean floor with the power of funk, and creating a black capitol through the power of funkaliciousness and yet it was still pop because of their focus on chorus. if they had had these funky bass lines and these yknow wicka wicka wong wong rhythms and shit and then had had all these verses and shit about the black condition, it wouldnt have worked. thats why we go to Funkadelic. 

funkadelic was the nonpop version of parliament. i can fucking count on both my hands the amount of funkadelic songs with fucking defiiiiiined choruses. it's just not a thing. funkadelic was for the underground folks who were really interested in the message, and parliament was for the people. all the people. the white people and the black people and all the other shades of brown in between. the way you knew it was for the poeople was through their use of the chorus. the the continued repetition of the choruses and the very clearly spoken and enunciated ideas that george clinton had about america. that shit was fuckin shot into your brain waves with a fuckin purpose.

this is the thing thats beautiful about pop music. 

pop music has a fuckin needle into the arm of the american populous. it's a main vein right into the heart of the american people. pop music is where change happens. pop music is where messages are carried out. yeah people are ok with gay people. people are like yeah gay people are pretty cool. sometimes gay people compliment my clthes and thats pretty dope. i like gay people.

and then lady gaga comes out with ""born this way"" and that shit is fucking sky roketing the gay message of ""gay and damn proud of it"" into the fucking stratosphere.

you feel me?

george clinton is an idealist. we know this because of albums like black city. he truly cared about the condition of black people in america and he truly wanted to advance it. he had funkadelic. he had this rock fusion of with funk and he was allowing his band mates and himself to be creative all over that shit. he was fucking grooving. he was having a grand old time. but he realized this shit wasn't just about himself. this shit is about everyone.

so he's like ok i gotta fuckin get these ideas out there. nobody's gonna fuckin listen to these weirdo guitar solo-laden albums about fuckin black chicks on mars and brain maggots and shit like that. they're just not. this shit isn't gonna reach the people who truly need to understand my message. so he wrestles parliament out of a copyright battle and he creates a side project and now he's taking that funk, that funk that is a metaphor for the blackness that flows through his music, and he combines it with what? what's popular in the 1970s? he knows he needs to be popular to reach the people. he needs to reach the people, reach the airwaves, to truly communicate his message to the appropriate audience (and how ironic that his magnum opus, *Mothership Connection* takes the form of a radio station teaching the concept of funk to aliens). 

so he combines that funk with soul, one of the most popular genres of teh day, and pop which is obviously consistently the most popular genre just by the nature of the genre's existence. now when he brings in the soul is when he brings in all the background singers and the emphasis on sung vocals. but when he brings in the pop, that's when he brings in the chorus. see you dudes thought i was just rambling and that i'd never get back to the point of this post.

well i did. i got there. it all had a point. i had a plan.

when he brings pop into the fold, he brings this fucking revolutionary use of the chorus with him. now the call and response singing style is not new. it's very much present in african music (like truly african music), in sailing shanties, in all kinds of nonsense. 

&gt;**""hey mister tally man, tally me banana""**

&gt;*""Daylight come and me wan' go home""

That type of shit. It's been around forever. But the way george clinton uses it, with these vocal embellishments and the hammering of these ideas into somebodies head, is new. It's fresh. He says these choruses over and over and over again and with each repetition they almost gain new context. It's like with each continued repetition of the chorus, the listener is informed with a new reason as to why the choir is preaching this rhetoric.

this isn't pop chorus for the sake of remembrance, not pop chorus for the sake of making the listener acquainted with the words and remembering the song. these choruses are repeated with *reason*. these choruses, each repetition comes with a new weight and act as yet another hammer swing banging a nail of truth into the listener's skull.

tell me what you think about george clinton's use of the chorus and let me know if you think it was an unconventional use, or if it was p normal and that i'm wrong. 

here's a spotify link to the album in question: https://open.spotify.com/album/734MC4wQsfNWsg9HLTrUoN Idk about ""off my ass"". I was just over the threshold where the question ""is this a good idea?"" Didn't fall into my head, lol.

I figured that /r/popheads might appreciate some navel-gazing about the third album ever made!

Artpop’s a surprisingly difficult album to approach. For starters, the production is maximalist to the point of being a little clumsy. “Sexxx Dreams” is a total banger, but the hooks are slathered in so much electric RNB-sleaze that’s it’s hard to find them. Even if you can wrap your mouth around the music, Gaga’s sense of humor can be a little hard to swallow. A little part of my good Catholic soul died the first time I heard such tactful hooks as, “Uranus, don’t you know my ass is famous” and “I’m a rich bitch, I’m the upper class.” However, death is the first step of rebirth and I can’t think of a better strut-to-class song than “Fashion!” 

I rag on the production, but I’ve also not heard another album quite like Artpop. Tracks like “Swine” build and drop and grind in ways that are both unnervingly unnatural and forcefully primal. Nothing screams drunk drag queen with no luggage but a whole lot of bedsheets and a butter knife ready to serve problematic orientalist realness like “Aura.” The overall effect is both impressive and gaudy, music made from glitter and grease. Every song is instantly iconic, or at least infamous.

Track-by-track:

Aura: A psychedelic electric eclectic rager made for a hypothetical dance floor where everyone is a little drunk and convinced that their every motion is an artistic defiance of the patriarchy. Please invite me to this party.

Venus: Category is: Mrs.Jetson doing trade outside the club. This may or may not be the most played song on my iPhone because of the one time I looped it for 5 hours while doing programming assignments.

G.U.Y.: To quote 30 Rock: “this song caused a spike in summer sex crimes.” But it’s a forceful, sexy banger with a #iconic music video. If you’re in a relationship with another top, play this track at low volumes while he sleeps and enjoy your improved sex life.

Sexxx Dreams: Not a good song to sing around straight roommates.

Jewels N Drugs: Killer hook, but tbh af there’s about 2 minutes without Lady Gaga and idk how I feel about that.

Manicure: Most historians agree that Lady Gaga invented hooks in 2007, but a growing wave of researchers believe that hooks weren’t fully weaponized until she got a mah, mah, mah, manicure in 2013.

Do What U Want: Tbh I really dislike the album version, but the Christina Aguilera duo is everything. Def a competition to see which queen can do a better Christina Aguilera impression but I think Gaga pulls ahead. Side note: I want to perform this song naked in front of Westboro Baptists for Pride 2017.

Artpop: I do that hand motions for this song at least once a month in the shower, but I have no ideas what the verses are trying to say. Oh well, meaning is an overrate social construct anyways.

Swine: I voiced my thoughts on the production earlier, but I will say that I credit shouting along to “Swy aye aye aye aye aye ine” for a lot of sore throats.

Donatella: If you’re not doing anrexia, you’re not doing drag! Jk, pls call:
Fashion!: This is like, her third song with fashion in the title, and tbh it’s the worst. The breakdown towards the end is fab af, but it three minutes to get there that could have been spent checking out artpop volume 2 rumors online.Mary Jane Holland: I’ve never been cool enough for someone to offer me drugs, so I must say this song isn’t my favorite.Dope: A number eight hit because of an accounting error by Billboard. Love this song, but I wish Princess Die had made it instead.Gypsy: Obviously inspired by “Run Away With Me,” this Gaga classic lives up to the original. It makes me want to dance, scream, travel, and learn some geography all at the same time. Side note: this will be the first dance song at my wedding.

Applause: The whole Katy v Gaga thing was really dumb. It’s rather obvious that although Roar did Rise like a Firework to the top of the charts, we should all Just Dance to Applause.
 Artpop is her best album to date IMO. When it first came out I didn't get it and thought it was really light weight. Then she released the 11 minute video called Artpop and it changed my mind.

Karin Park's newest album is a heavy and empowering pop album with all the attention being directed at Karin's boldness. If you like a fine blend of alternative electronic music and wonky pop music than you'll like this.

For those who are unaware, BOOTS is the stage name of american producer Jordan Asher. Best known for his work on Beyonce's 2013 S/T album along with his production for FKA Twigs and Run the Jewels. Aquaria is his debut album which mixes a blend of RnB, rap, electronic, pop, and experimental buzz in a bleak atmosphere that best suits his shady public image. 

If you're a fan of The Weeknd, Son Lux, Eels, or FKA Twigs. Then you'll probably like this guys work.

**MisterWives - Our Own House**

MisterWives are a young, energetic trio who mix synth pop with a barebones approach to ska music. This album is extremely fun and Mandy Lee's strong vocal range will probably turn a few heads. These guys are on the brink of mainstream exposure, so listen to them early for that l33t hipster cred.

**George Clanton - 100% Electronica**

This is basically the 1984 of pop albums. George Clanton has a special little blend of 90s/80s pop/new wave and modern day vaporwave in what can only be described a beautiful flustercuck of a fusion. It's all original composition though (0 samples like most vaporwave) and George's vocals add a lot of depth to the music. It's worth checking out and it's also free.

**Chaos Chaos - Committed to the Chaos**

This EP actually came out in late 2014, but it had 0 attention until Do You Feel It appeared on Rick and Morty. Just a nice little synth pop EP for your ears.

Stream: [Do You Feel It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTA0DSfrGZ0)

**KATE BOY - ONE**

Originally a trio (now a duo) Kate Boy are an electronic pop act that mix wonky bass and percussion with very gritty deep female vocals. Very original and experimental output that is a lot of fun to listen to. 

Stream: [The Way We Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1-Zl6PGjKc)

**Everything Everything - Get to Heaven**

This album is far more popular in the UK than it is in the US, so this is aimed towards us freedom people.

Art Rock/pop album that tackles the fears of those living in the modern world with an almost ironic twist of fun indie pop. You get the critical commentary of terrorism, british rule, day-to-day society and what not. Think Radiohead and The Talking Heads deciding to form a pop band. You got a lot of different influences on this record including that of Radiohead, Foster the People, and Tears for Fears. though this album is way better than fosterthepeople. 

Stream: [Distant Past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQPVApfa9rE)

**Neon Indian - Vega Intl. Night School**

Synth pop that is super duper good and how people aren't talking about this blows my mind. 

Stream: [Slumlord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw6LDVPst_0)

**Ciara - Jackie**

Ciara returned with her ""good girl gone bad"" album this year. Though she didn't get the memo that the edgy ""BMF"" trend died in 2009 with Miley Cyrus so she had to settle with boobs on the album cover to remind people she still existed. This album is kind of a mixing pot of really good and really bad (LOL AT THE CRUNK SONGS) so listen at your own risk. 

Stream: [Jackie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGpLBN4S5W8)

**U.S Girls - Half Free**

Arguably the least pop album of the list, but still pop nonetheless. U.S. Girls has this really overwhelming feeling of dread in it. Like theres something unnerving about it that you notice on it's usually calm surface that shimmers through parts. It's intriguing to listen to and trying to decode what exactly makes it so unnerving. Great dark album.

Stream: [Window Shades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoTehhwo7Iw)

**Chungking - Defender**

A little different for pop music. Most of it is very quiet and subdued, focusing more of ambient electronic/piano led ballads than your usually upbeat song (for those familiar with her early work, this rings especially true) its just a nice charming album thats worth a gander. 

Stream: [Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPNgpqEXm4U)

**Clarence Clarity - No Now**

Me album of the year. This is truly one of the most unique and downright amazing albums to have come out in such a long time. Clarence is literally the living embodiment of A E S T H E T I C with the mixture of RnB/electronic/experimental buzz attacking your eardrums like the most seductive bees you've ever heard. Not to mention just how insane the album gets with it's share of breakdowns and constant left field turns into new territory. It's a full on trip from start to finish, and it's hard to say that you cant even find one song on here that you don't like. Check it out please!

Stream: [Those Who Can't, Cheat [NSFW]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMl8eZoudJE)

**Susanne Sundfor - Ten Love Songs**

Synthy pop stuff with mixtures of synthpop and soulful piano ballads here and there. Half fun, half gut wrenching. Great album for the lonely winter nights.

Stream: [Accelerate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3492o3pfEWI)

**Joywave - How Do You Feel Now?**

This guy's previous work was pretty hit or miss, but thankfully with this new album Joywave was able to find a stride that works really well. Fun synth poppy rocky times.

Stream: [Destruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98b2X5LPymM)

**Big Data - 2.0**

The only song anyone really knows off of this is Dangerous. What they're missing on is a pop album with a lot of great collabs from anyone like Kimbra or Rivers Cuomo. It's choopy, it's glitchy, it's catchy, and it's a whole lotta fun.

Stream: [Dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWPcid4l74U)

**HOLYCHILD - The Shape of Brat-Pop to Come**

What is brat pop? Well, I dunno. What I do know is that this album's tital riffs off of The Shape of Punk to Come (which is an amazing album BTW) and it's an amazing catchy and well thought out pop album with a lot of current and lesser known trends in it's production. If you've been looking for an album that ties together the pop of the 90s, 2000s, and today perfectly... than look no further than this. 

Stream: [Barbie Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2heeNJEFt8c)

**Mysterskulls - Ultra Rare Vol. 1**

If you guys thought that the new Mystery Skulls LP was kinda bad (at least I did) than thankfully Luis released a compilation of unreleased recordings from his past 5 years under the Mystery Skulls persona. It's a little rough around the edges, but it simply screams the simplistic contagiousness of his EP and singles like Ghost. 

Stream: [Soul on Fire](https://mysteryskulls.bandcamp.com/track/soul-on-fire)

**The Japanese House - Clean**

Cute little EP with production from The 1975. Yet it itself is pretty unique and tackles a pretty smooth aesthetic. Great for those who need a bite sized snack.

Stream: [Clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh7qikFginI)

**Estelle - True Romance**

Good ol' Estelle. This album has a more laid back feel to it than her standard pop fare, but you still have some great tracks scattered here and there which are worth checking out. 

Stream: [All The Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERY821lDg0)

**Mika - No Place in Heaven**

It seems that once Mika grew up, everyone else moved on from him. It's criminal that everyone else moved on from him. Besides the lone single that came out for it, there was literally no attention directed at this album. Way more refined and mature than his older stuff, but still just as playful as ever. No Place In Heaven is worth checking out.

Note that most of these sound different than your standard radio fare. I don't know if thats a turn off to y'all or not so I'm just putting a disclaimer there. Edit: I apologize for any grammar errors. This was a quick write up so I didn't have time to make it perfect. 


**Karin Park - Apocalypse Pop**

**BOOTS - Aquaria**

For those who are unaware, BOOTS is the stage name of american producer Jordan Asher. Best known for his work on Beyonce's 2013 S/T album along with his production for FKA Twigs and Run the Jewels. Aquaria is his debut album which mixes a blend of RnB, rap, electronic, pop, and experimental buzz in a bleak atmosphere that best suits his shady public image. 

If you're a fan of The Weeknd, Son Lux, Eels, or FKA Twigs. Then you'll probably like this guys work.

**MisterWives - Our Own House**

MisterWives are a young, energetic trio who mix synth pop with a barebones approach to ska music. This album is extremely fun and Mandy Lee's strong vocal range will probably turn a few heads. These guys are on the brink of mainstream exposure, so listen to them early for that l33t hipster cred.

Although his latest album feels somewhat like a retread of his previous outing, that is not necessarily a bad thing, because the stuff he produces is so solid.

Empty The Bones Of You and Body Riddle were real examples of making IDM music that is complex and borders on chaotic without falling into the trap of adding layers for the sake of layers. Everything is important on those albums.

Turning Dragon is his best work to date, in my opinion. Hard, dark techno with interspersed bits of Drill 'N Bass, Glitch and other IDM techniques makes for an amazing piece of work from start to finish.

(Helios)  OK well firstly, it's pretty darn hard to suggest similar artists to Helios, purely because he has such a unique, subtle and truly beautiful sound. Many the links below are probably DON'T bare much resemblance to the original song, but I figure some of them do (I guess). Either way, if you enjoyed Signed I Wish You Well, spend some time getting through some of these and you're likely to find a diamond-in-the-rough (or two).

That said, I really enjoy [this song by Unquote - an ambient/dubstep producer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu2oSQvMJTM) Which is a pretty damn beautiful production. And then there's [Bersarin Quartett](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6Pp_JKwmk) who make some pretty gnarly ambient stuff - but a definite lack of vocals (like most of these tunes). After listening to that it leads perfectly into the eighth wonder of the world - [Undiscovered Colours by The Flashbulb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS4IqBd9rUY) - definitely one of my current favourites.

After that you've got some [Dom Mino'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0yZu3liWMg) or maybe even some [Houses](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv4_4YdwcXo) - who are killing it right now on [Lefse Records](http://lefserecords.com/). Then of course there's [Rudi Arapahoe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enGiNcxmZOg), which is definitely a little less electronic and bordering on neo-classical, but still wicked (this track is off a series of free compilation albums which might be of interest to you - available at [The Silent Ballet website](http://www.thesilentballet.com/dnn/Compilations/tabid/53/Default.aspx)). [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy2B7YZMK30) another great song off the 9th volume of The Silent Ballet - by The Abbasi Brothers.

There's also a lot of mellow drum and bass and dubstep which could be of interest. And DON'T automatically assume I mean WUUBBB WUBBB WUBBBBBBB dubstep - because it's NOT all crap like that. Check out [this song by Phaeleh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNk9Cqxke-c) - a guy who's really been coming into his own lately in the ambient dubstep scene. Or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcD8TbF5zOQ) song by Glen E. Ston - a rather oldschool atmospheric drum and bass producer - full of gentle sounds.

You could also try [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6mR_BP7zKg) song by Amiina - which is pretty post-rockish and definitely of note. And of course [The Album Leaf](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e9F-nLhm4s) who are just plain wicked (I think they were mentioned somewhere above).

Just to finish off I'll just chuck some rather off-topic suggestions out there and see how you go. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywt-uNINIHc) sounds like it's straight off an RPG - by Kenmochi Hidefumi who in my books is absolutely destroying the Japanese hip-hop/tribal bongo scene. Then there's a bit of folk which you might enjoy (very, very relaxing), by [Sandro Perri](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbXceIoNAgw).

Or else you could crank some [Dfader](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAswrssu1e4) - also available for free download off an IDM compilation [here](http://label.idmforums.com/idmf003-mind-tree.html). Or some more post-rock by [Balmorhea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j32VMZDQL0) which is also one of my current favourite tunes. 

Then why not a bit of [classical](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izbdgn7vq8M) to finish off by the one and only Chaz Knapp.

To be honest I don't think that massive long post was even slightly helpful hahaha. I feel like I've left so many of the best songs out by mistake.

Help me rebuild my mp3 player; we can make it harder, better, faster, stronger... So I've got an 8GB Sony Walkman. Not much, but I'm a poor twentysomething and it was a Christmas present, so I'm not complaining. The problem is, I've pigeonholed my music library too much and have trouble deciding what to delete so I can add new music, when I actually find something.

I have, therefore, decided to more or less wipe it clean and start fresh. That's where you come in!

Below I'll list a rough outline of what I've had on there for a while to give you an idea of what I normally listen to and so that people don't recommend stuff I've already been listening to. 

Help me out, please. Most of what I've got is dubstep, drum'n'bass/jungle, breaks, some hip-hop, and (recently) some house courtesy of the fine folks at [/electrohouse](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse). Most stuff in those genres would probably be fine, although I tend to be wary of ""aggro"" wobble-heavy stomp dubstep, and I'm more of a deep/tech-house guy rather than what I think of as ""disco"" house.

So, more or less:

* Pendulum (Hold Your Colour, Jungle Sound Gold, Immersion)
* Benga (Diary of an Afro Warrior)
* Deadmau5
* General MIDI
* Bassnectar (a bunch)
* Kode9 and the Spaceape (Memories of the Future)
* Burial (a bunch)
* the /electrohouse compilations
* Tool's discography (not electronic, but that doesn't really ever leave my playlist)
* Calyx &amp; Teebee - Anatomy
* Evol Intent - Era of Diversion
* Black Sun Empire - Cruel &amp; Unusual
* Alaska
* Gorillaz discography
* Deltron 3030
* Parov Stelar (after I saw that kickass dance video a few days ago)
* A bunch of random breaks compilations (**Hey! More breaks would be great, and I don't really know where to start there**).
* A bunch of random dubstep compilations (Stepper's Delight, We Didn't Steal This EP, a few others)
* DJ Shadow (Endtroducing, Private Press)
* Cut Chemist - The Litmus Test
* RJD2 (Tinfoil Hat EP, Deadringer)

And I'm never sure really where that falls - it always seems like there's a set of really popular club electronica that gets radioplay outside of the electronic circles too, and it always has a specific sound. Does this cover a specific genre? Is it appropriate to refer to this as Club?

Also, it feels like most electronic genres are partially there to help DJs out - most trance can be mixed into most trance, for example, due to the similar basslines and song structure. It seems like this applies to these hits too, which leads me to the genre question. You seem to be talking about house in general. If You want to experience a wider musical spectrum, i think it's one of the better places to start:

I suggest you get it.  Meh. Pretty shitty album.

The tracks are good, it's just not good as an album. Feels kinda like he went ""hey so I have like 12 songs done, lets put a cover on it and call it a day"". It would have been so much better if every single track on the album wasn't already on YouTube.

""Raise Your Weapon"" is probably one of the better tracks on there; a lot of people either completely love it or hate it because of the dub twist at the end. The vocals are absolutely amazing. The singer has a beautiful voice that sits hauntingly over the dub beats....it's a really good contrast.

Bad Selection is probably closer to classic mau5 than any of the other tracks. It's fun and bouncey and reminds me a lot of some of the stuff on his 'At Play' releases.

I have no idea why he put the Michael Woods remix of ""I Said"" on the album. It definitely sticks out as the weakest track. There's literally no melody, it's just the same annoying sonar beep for 3 minutes, then a breakdown, then sonar beep again for 3 minutes.

I was really excited because I read on his Facebook awhile back that he was working on his first ""artist album"", so when I saw that 4x4=12 was announced I was really stoked. Then I read the tracklist and was like "".....but...I've heard all these....""

Both tracks with Sofi are pretty cool, she has a sexy sounding voice and it's nice to hear deadmau5 try new genres so that he doesn't get stuck on that ""plucked chords on every 8th note"" sound he became famous for. Though I do wish mau5 would push out another Random Album Title....or another second half of FLOABN (Word Problems, Bot, STROBE.)

Anyway, I'm rambling on a bit. I'm still a huge fan and I'll go out and buy the album (I'm a sucker for physical copies), but I still can't help but feel disappointed by 4x4=12, even though most of the tracks are still very good.

I suggest you get it.  Meh. Pretty shitty album.

The tracks are good, it's just not good as an album. Feels kinda like he went ""hey so I have like 12 songs done, lets put a cover on it and call it a day"". It would have been so much better if every single track on the album wasn't already on YouTube.

""Raise Your Weapon"" is probably one of the better tracks on there; a lot of people either completely love it or hate it because of the dub twist at the end. The vocals are absolutely amazing. The singer has a beautiful voice that sits hauntingly over the dub beats....it's a really good contrast.

Bad Selection is probably closer to classic mau5 than any of the other tracks. It's fun and bouncey and reminds me a lot of some of the stuff on his 'At Play' releases.

I have no idea why he put the Michael Woods remix of ""I Said"" on the album. It definitely sticks out as the weakest track. There's literally no melody, it's just the same annoying sonar beep for 3 minutes, then a breakdown, then sonar beep again for 3 minutes.

I was really excited because I read on his Facebook awhile back that he was working on his first ""artist album"", so when I saw that 4x4=12 was announced I was really stoked. Then I read the tracklist and was like "".....but...I've heard all these....""

Both tracks with Sofi are pretty cool, she has a sexy sounding voice and it's nice to hear deadmau5 try new genres so that he doesn't get stuck on that ""plucked chords on every 8th note"" sound he became famous for. Though I do wish mau5 would push out another Random Album Title....or another second half of FLOABN (Word Problems, Bot, STROBE.)

Anyway, I'm rambling on a bit. I'm still a huge fan and I'll go out and buy the album (I'm a sucker for physical copies), but I still can't help but feel disappointed by 4x4=12, even though most of the tracks are still very good.

I've heard their big songs, but nothing about those songs has made me want to hear more, it's just ""meh"" to me.

Is Daft Punk widely regarded to be awesome because of their music, or because of their crazy shows?  If it's their music, what should I listen to that will make me understand the appeal?

I love electronic music, but maybe house just isn't my thing (I do love r/proghouse though).   Daft Punk changed EDM with their 'Homework' and 'Discovery' albums. They were solid, incredibly catchy, and well-produced albums. What's not to love? For a lot of the people who are into EDM now, Daft Punk were probably the ones who brought them into the fold after hearing one of their tracks on the radio. 

I'm not a fan of their later works (Robot Rock was awful imo), but they definitely upped the ante when they returned with their live show. Not only is it absolutely spectacular on its own merits, but if you think about it in the context of your childhood hero making a comeback in the most inventive and kick-ass way possible, you will understand why it's almost heresy to badmouth Daft Punk in the EDM community.

I honestly don't mean to start a flame war or anything. I'm just hoping to discuss why it seems like so many people find him and his music so appealing.

My humble personal opinion: he has a few interesting songs here and there in that they're a bit catchy, but even then they're not very dynamic. I feel like in general his songs only really express a mediocre level of musicality, and again, aren't very musically dynamic but rather relatively flat.

I've only recently gotten into electronic music about 6 or 7 months ago. Since then I've been exploring a lot of what's out there, and trying to understand the allure of each subgenre and its artists. But taking Deadmau5's music at face value, I just haven't been able to understand why it's so appealing. Maybe it's just the cool headgear (okay I apologize.. maybe that was a bit too low).

So again, I'm not trying to straight up bash his music. I honestly just want to see what you see in his music that makes it so attractive to you; maybe there's a perspective to his music that I haven't really explored yet. And if you don't like his music, why not?

I'm not looking for old-school 70's disco though.  I'm looking for more modern electronic-disco with harder beats that would be a lot of fun to dance to

Here's some of what I have so far to give you an idea of what I'm talking about:

And then they throw in some poetic interpretation at the end when they run out of ""sound jargon"" to show you how amazing the song is and what you should feel from it? 

Case in point, taken from Pitchfork's review of Night Plane's ""Parallel Lines""

""'Parallel Lines'"" is woven around a slowly shifting trance-like backbone that roots the track in a near-constant state of anticipation. Synth drones and squelchy Roland TB-303-style patterns are phased in and out, while tangled-up male/female voices are methodically interlaced with the instrumentation. **It's in those dual vocals that the song picks up its melancholy undertow, making it feel like a paean to a lone raver, lost in sound, willing the night to black out the encroaching daybreak.**""

I guess to be more serious about this, does anybody actually read these descriptions and allow them to affect your listening experience? Like, if you listened to the above song, would you try to feel like the darkness of night is trying to suffocate the sun as it rises above horizon at dawn, just as the lone raver tried accomplishing on his own? 

I'm all for poetic, descriptive writing. Hell, my favorite classes in high school were Creative Writing I and II. But having been an electronic music fan for about the past 8 years, I just find it kind of hilarious that this little world of over-the-top music description exists. When a music link on reddit takes me to a place like Pitchfork, I just try to hear the music my way instead of reading someone else's description first and inetivably be disappointed *EVERY TIME* the music doesn't live up to the phantasmagorical metaphors they pre-instill in my mind. Oh you're so right :D

I always wonder whether the reviewer actually gets these ideas from the tune as such or just makes up something like what you quoted.   
All I would recognize in a tune would be the beat pattern and the general mood of the music (synths, melody, bass).

I like Autechre. I don't love them, but I like them (especially their early stuff with incunabula being my favorite) but once I hit the era of *EP5*, it kind of lost me. What I want to know is what exactly do people see in their music now. I purchased their new album *Oversteps* today, and it seems to be a nice blend of the Ambient stuff which I love so much and the program stuff that they are now know for.  Rae from LP5 is one of my favourite electronic tracks. The winding, meandering chord progression is absolutely top notch, it's really expressive. It does drag on a bit though. 

As for the latest stuff, on Oversteps, there's a lot of chaos occurring, but in the midst of it there's always a coherent melody. At first I couldn't really interpret it, but once I got through the bizarre timbres and crazy drum sounds, it all became clear. Maybe being on acid and removing mental filters would make this album sound very different. 

For me, Quaristice was a lot less accessible, less melodic, I think they actually use 12 tone techniques on it but I dunno, it's just like listening to Messiaen really. This is *real* chin-stroking stuff and should probably appeal to a different subset people compared to Oversteps. What an absolutely massive album though.

Help a fellow redditor out? I've only come to find out how much I like electronic music in the past year or 2, but I'm out of the loop and don't quite know how to find more.  I like artists like the prodigy and propellerheads.

Can you guys suggest some more artists or maybe a website that's a good resource?

Thanx in advance.

Edit:  Here's a little more detail about how I choose what music to listen to:

I generally don't like songs so much as the music behind the songs.  If I hear lyrics that sound pretentious or tell me someone's life story, then I usually won't like the song.  I'm not ruling out all vocals though.  Tracks like ""warrior's dance"" by the prodigy gain a lot from the vocals, and I don't mind cryptic stuff like the singer in ""velvet pants"" by the propellerheads.

MOAR BASS!  &lt;-- No.  Ridiculous amounts of bass don't make music sound better.  I do like layers and layers of different sounds going on all at once though.

I have some pointed opinions and I know it probably sounds like I'm preaching, but I'm just trying to help you help me find music. Thanx for listing the specific genres.  That's a huge help.

I don't really like Aphex twin from what I've heard, so I don't understand the hype surrounding them.

Aslan Faction sounded pretty good until it got to the vocals.

The chemical brothers... I'm 3 minutes into ""Escape Velocity"" and I'm shitting bricks.  7:35 in... The wind-like sounds in the background made me seriously think there was a tornado outside my house.  A tornado hit my town just last night and it's been storming, so I literally believed it.  I'm definitely impressed.

The crystal method sounds great.  I kick back and listen to this and zone out.

The first couple Combichrist songs I came across didn't really appeal to me from the second the lyrics started, but the accompanying music is great.  ""This is my rifle"" sounded pretty good.  I'm getting the general idea that aggrotech isn't my thing.

3 mins into heavyweight and I'm shitting harder bricks than before.  It's only been 3 minutes, but it felt like 10.  That's a hell of an illusion and you are my new best friend for introducing me to this genius.  This artist is awesome.

kmfdm doesn't sound bad, but it's not the type of music I'm looking for.  I do like the retro videos though.

Nine inch nails didn't sound bad either, but it's still not my thing.

So, show us your stuff!

For starters, I am [BLACK CLOUD](http://soundcloud.com/black-cloud). 

EDIT: A lot of talent up in here, and a great response. Keep putting them up.

EDIT 2: Damn TimeWarner Cable on Friday in Brooklyn. Too many people streaming movies. Nothing will buffer.  I'm the producer of alien band [Galactaron](http://soundcloud.com/galactaron). It's synthpop and rock for the most part. This is the short paragraph I usually send to blogs to describe the band: 

""Galactaron is a fictional band of aliens. The album is the soundtrack to an electro musical, the story of their visit to Earth. It covers the excitement of meeting Emily Wong, a Chinese-American and their first human, through the turmoil of government intervention and culture shock.""

It's a virtual band. I do all the art and music for it and I just released it on iTunes and Amazon etc. It took a lot of work, like 6 months, and I'm quite happy with it.

Here's my soundcloud page where you can listen to the whole album (I suggest skipping the intro song and listening to First Contact, Attention, The Synthesizer, or With Just One Moon to get an idea of what it's like):

I've been trying really hard to find blogs to review my album so I can promote it but it's been practically impossible. Most blogs are inundated with requests to review an album, I'm not a DJ and I don't do shows or anything, so it's a little hard for me to get through. It's especially when the world seems to revolve around dubstep and house so much right now. I've started entering remix competitions, to try and get recognition, in hopes I can win and get a paid soundcloud account so I can put my songs into appropriate drop boxes.

The next full length player from techno upstarts Delsin is a co-release between the man who made it, Morphosis aka Rabih Beaini and close associate M&gt;O&gt;S. Entitled “What Have We Learned”, it should come as no surprise that this is material and a release of the highest order. Beaini has been crafting away in the nether-regions of the techno underworld since the 90s and his talent is very plain to see. Kicking off with a slo-mo techno march, the percussive clatter of ‘Silent Screamer’ sets off on a course that is nothing you’d expect, yet everything you’d want. Over the space of 10 tracks, he manages to continually morph through a plethora of grainy landscapes, steeped in a film of dusty static. Sometimes lighting the way with a female vocal or occasionally pairing things down to a well rounded thud. The rattle and hum of instruments merely serve as reference points in an otherwise heavy sonic blanket that ranges from the dark acid tones of “Too Far” to the palpable earthiness of “Gate of Night”. Churning the listener round and around, Morphosis’ dark and long take on house, techno and electronic fusions explore and engage in a highly original way. With influences ranging from Krautrock to New Wave, Beaini is far away from treading over old ground.

I liked Jay O's music, but the vocals were very distracting from the rest of it.

I like Deadmau5, but who is Wolfgang Gartner?  That track is sick!  Much was gained from these two working together.  I did some searching, and this guys is pretty awesome.

And I know most people on this site will disagree with me but I really like 'Till The Worlds Ends', it's catchy it has a great hook and it's overall a really well made quality pop song that stands out from most shit pop that gets put out these days. On much the same note, this is an awesome remix. It drastically changes the structure of the original but leaves in the hook as a build up to give the crowd that sense of familiarity in a tune that they already know, then turns around and hits them with a just fucking crazy ass electro drop.

However as a DJ i find a hard time finding a place and a crowd for this song. The drop is really too offbeat for most mainstream/lightly electro crowds at a normal party who would be most familiar with the song. And I imagine snobby electro heads being put off by the fact that it's britney, despite my feelings that the original is a pretty brilliantly made pop hit.

If you listen to Wolfgang's ""Undertaker,"" it was clearly influenced by ""Ghost n Stuff.""

Going back to some of deadmau5's earlier stuff, Kaskade has a similar progressive house sound to the mau5, with a little more trancey feel. ""I Remember"" might be my favorite song, ever.

Also check out Morgan Page - Longest Road (deadmau5 remix).

deadmau5 is characterized, in my opinion, by his wonderful production and commitment to minimalism. His songs are really simple, and he brings so many fans to EDM. That being said, as you grow more comfortable with the genre, your tastes will probably change.

Swedish House Mafia, Avicii, and Calvin Harris are kind of similar with a little more vocals and more embellishments to their tracks.

I got into electronic music via basshunter (his old stuff, for the love of god). Then I was introduced to hardstyle and have been listening to it exclusively ever since. A lot of people don't realize that modern hardstyle is actually very melodic - much different from how it was even a few years ago, and that's why I like it.

I didn't get too far into electronic music before hardstyle, so I feel like I'm missing some stuff. 

What I like are songs with powerful melodies that aren't just short and simple. Here's a couple of hardstyle songs that i love to give you an example (linked so it jumps to the melodies):  

[The Pitcher - Savor Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXMmYZtwQ4&amp;hd=1&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=150s)  
[D-Block &amp; S-te-Fan vs. Wildstylez - The Human Soul](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CJ5_eEiYOM&amp;hd=1&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=160s)

Now here is an example of some older basshunter stuff that I like:  
[BassHunter - Festfolk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDt9fDXNqCk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=171s)

Although the hardstyle is more hard (as it says on the tin), old school basshunter and modern hardstyle share the same melody structure. I hope you can hear what I'm talking about, because this is so hard to explain.

I'm looking for some genre of music along these lines. I don't like modern trance - I absolutely hate singing in electronic music. What should I look for to find music in the old style of basshunter? I don't want some overly cheesy shit like cascada either, that's the other far end of the spectrum. Wow hardstyle has changed quite a bit. I stopped listening a bit over a year ago but mostly listened to stuff from earlier than that. 

Anyway, you might like [Strobe - Deadmau5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKi9Z-f6qX4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=405s). I know that generally these folks don't like the mau5 but I was what popped in my head.

I've recently discovered my love for songs that, basically, start off relatively slow or 'mellow' in feel, and then increase more and more in excitement, building the tension as you listen, the beat climbing and climbing and *climbing and climbing and climbing*, and just when you think you're going to burst and you can't take it anymore, that sweet *sweet* drop hits you and you go abso-fuckin-lutley nuts! The longer the time between the start and the drop, the better.

More importantly, he's one of the under-appreciated geniuses of electronic music. Rather than blather on for a bit, i'll just link to a bunch of his songs.

I suggest checking out multiple songs here. He has one of the most incredibly varied array of musical styles at work, and the genre seems to change wildly from song to song. If you don't like one song of his, you may like another.

* You probably already know [Flat Beat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLGu1GmbzYk).
* Electro animals should enjoy [Positif](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeYRAF1GSSs)
* My personal favourite, the very funky and bizzarely named [Cut Dick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VARyFuO5w10)
* This one is brand new and sounds like something from Legend of Zelda: [Polocaust](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prLAqocB7ME)
* A very messed up song based around the twist ending of The Sixth Sense: [Bruce Willis Is Dead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2URCCjoyFk)

He's also a filmmaker, with such videos as [this weird thing](http://vimeo.com/8496873) starring Flat Eric and a rather odd (Avant-Garde, maybe?) looking upcoming film called [Rubber](http://vimeo.com/12713995) Isn't he the reincarnation of Michael Jackson as well?

The group is [PeaceTreaty](http://soundcloud.com/peacetreaty/) and they are making some of the sickest dutch/electro out there. For those of you who are turned off by dutch, just give these guys a chance, their dutch is totally different from guys like Laidback Luke and Afrojack. Their bigroom sound and trip out synths absolutely kill it on the dancefloor Heres some of their highlights (they have two originals, neither of which are on soundcloud):

* The tune that got my attention originally (and is still one of my favorites) is [their remix of Ke$ha's Blah Blah Blah](http://soundcloud.com/peacetreaty/ke-ha-blah-blah-blah-skeet-skeet-peacetreaty-remix) (just because the original sucks, doesn't mean the remix has to).
* Another great one is [their remix of Gooffee's tune Flow](http://soundcloud.com/peacetreaty/gooffee-flow-peacetreaty-remix). It starts off slow but it develops into a ridiculous banger.
* Their remix of [Kraymer &amp; R!M!E - Oh So!](http://soundcloud.com/peacetreaty/kraymer-r-m-e-oh-so-peacetreaty-remix) is long in the build up but absolutely insane post drop.
* Another great remix: [French Fries- Senta (PeaceTreaty ft. Disk Jo Slim Red Stripe Remix)](http://soundcloud.com/peacetreaty/french-fries-senta-peacetreaty-ft-disk-jo-slim-red-stripe-remix)
* Last one in the list, but **definitely** not the least is [their remix of Kissed With A Noise's Watuppp](http://soundcloud.com/peacetreaty/kissed-with-a-noise-ft-young-buck-watuppp-peacetreaty-remix)

**artists that I like**:


* Digitalism - I pretty much love all of their stuff.. I think they're brilliant.

* [Boyz noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PysYTEJiso8) - They have a lot of songs with sick bass ( although their songs are somewhat repetitive )

* Daft punk - need I say more? Technologic is one of my all-time favorite song.

* Groove Armada - I'm not sure if I should say they are an electro band, but I loved pretty much everything on [Best of Groove Armada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_of_Groove_Armada) -  [At the River](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-uztVX6QFQ_) is especially nice.. Got me into downtempo because of that song.

* Boards of Canada - Good chill-out stuff. 

* Justice - some of their stuff is too ""harsh"" for me, but I think [D.A.N.C.E](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49esza4eiK4) is just goddamn brilliant (or maybe I secretly love Jackson 5) Also like Phantom and Genesis.

* Fatboy Slim - Palookaville was pretty good. It also had [Christopher Walken](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ky5R-vxns) in it.

* David Guetta



**Couple of songs I liked:**


* [I See Girls, Studio B](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vABC_DYnjAU)(noun) 1. Phat Bass

* [Weekend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR8jOJZERhs)

* [Satisfaction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5bYDhZBFLA) - Although I think Benny Bennasi's kinda one-trick pony..

* [Perfect Exceeder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZl165WDjDA)

* [Dr Pressure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9grWoCEZHFI)

* [Too Many Dicks on the Dance Floor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94T_BFBHQ_U) - No, I'm not kidding.

* [Insomnia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuqEbRzy_t8&amp;feature=av2n)

* [Acceptable in the 80s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SpDr9FOIPI)


**The bands I didn't like that much (not that they're bad, it's just not my type):**

* Goldfrapp (I tried, but all I thought was ""meh."")

* deadmau5 (I don't really get the hype)

* Breath Carolina - I know, but I kept thinking ""my god, this band would be awesome if they just removed all the screaming and replaced it with actual melody.

* Trance/Techno.. I don't really like these guys that much.

[deleted] Damn. I had a whole reply written out complete with reasons for the listings, then accidentally closed the tab. Will try it again, although this won't be as good because I've already put so much time and effort into it.

So, I wanted to expand on your list by going even further back in time, frequently outside what would normally be considered electronic, to find hugely influential work.

We begin our journey with the minimal new music crowd, most importantly **Steve Reich** and **Terry Reilly**. In the 50's and 60's, the minimalist classical composers were on the cutting edge of music theory, using modern recording and experimental techniques to change the way people thought about music. Reich especially is known for his work with tapes and [phase shifting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasing), looping and syncing sounds to create the appearance of new sounds from within them. ""It's a gonna rain"" is largely considered the first piece to use phase shifting purposefully. _Music for 18 Musicians_ (get the Ensemble Modern recording) is hugely influential in all genres of music today, using phasing and other experimental techniques to create an ensemble piece (as opposed to his previous solo and process pieces). _18_ is also really beautiful, one of my favorite minimalist albums.

Next comes Jazz. Yes, Jazz. **Miles Davis** and **Herbie Hancock**, in particular. Both were at the forefront of experimental jazz, and a lot of what is new and interesting in electronic music was first done by these two. Pick up Davis' _In a Silent Way_ and Hancock's _Crossings_. Hancock plays more with beat structure, and Davis more with dissonance (to generalize so wildly that it might not be meaningful, especially since the two played in each others' groups so often). _In a Silent Way_ is has precursors to a lot of ambient work and bass-driven electro, while _Crossings_ plays around with drum structure. Both albums are hugely important for their use of electronic instruments and filters in the music. Electro is still being influenced by Davis in particular.

Next is **Brian Eno**. Motherfucker practically invented electronic music single-handedly. _Music for Airports_ is the first ambient album, and also where it's at. Eno bridged the gap between classical composer and popular music producer, then bridged the gap between producer and musician. And he's still producing music, creating a lot of the sounds you hear on the radio and on obscure albums, and doing experimental work with generative music.

So we come to Brian Eno's friend and collaborator, **David Bowie**. _Space Oddity_, _The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars_, and the Berlin Trilogy all made a lasting impact on both electronic music and rock and roll. _Space Oddity_ and _Ziggy Stardust_ were some of the earliest pop records to use tape recording techniques to drastically change the sounds on the album. And his Berlin Trilogy was heavily influenced by his friendship and collaboration with Kraftwerk, who were in turn influenced by him.

For more pop influences, **Pink Floyd**. Syd Barrette was probably the first pop musician to use tapes to their full effects, before even Bowie. Think their [early work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTfDUyUkVYE), the noise shit, the whooping, sampled, filtered, loud shit. They continued this even in their later, conceptual, more R&amp;R stuff (think the registers on ""Money"" or the clocks on ""Time"" or the voice samples throughout _Dark Side of the Moon_, and the fact that _Dark Side_ and especially _Wish You Were Here_ rely heavily on sounds made possible only through tape recording techniques). They also pioneered the use of light shows in their live shows, but that's not really here or there, musically.

Finally, a bit of an excursion, but if you like French electro (Air, Daft Punk, Justice, etc.), then you need to listen to **Serge Gainsbourg**. I'm not a huge fan of most his work, but Serge was _the_ pioneer in French music, pushing it from its purely chanson stage (focused on vocals above plain instrumentals) into experimental territory. Listen to even his early chanson stuff, and you'll begin hearing him in all French electro, especially Air.

So, I hope that's helpful. None of it beyond Eno would normally be called electronic music, but all of it was cutting edge experimental music using electronic instruments or recording techniques as an integral part of the music, and all of it heavily influenced how those techniques are used today in electronic music.

**edit** Thought of something else. The Doctor Who theme is considered one of the first pieces of electronic music, being created entirely from tape-recorded samples (this was pre-synth).",It's Gonna Rain,Steve Reich,77.7777777777777,72.7272727272727,"['minimalist classical composers were on the cutting edge of music theory', 'phasing and other experimental techniques', 'using tapes and phase shifting, looping and syncing sounds', 'Miles Davis more with dissonance', 'Herbie Hancock plays more with beat structure', 'Brian Eno bridged the gap between classical composer and popular music producer', 'tape recording techniques to drastically change the sounds', 'using electronic instruments and filters']","[""Steve Reich's work is influential in all genres of music today"", 'Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock at the forefront of experimental jazz', 'Brian Eno practically invented electronic music', ""David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy was influenced by Kraftwerk"", ""Pink Floyd's use of tapes to their full effect before Bowie"", 'Serge Gainsbourg influences French electro artists like Air and Daft Punk']",[],[],,"['Steve Reich known for phase shifting techniques', 'Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock influential for use of electronic instruments', ""Brian Eno's Music for Airports considered the first ambient album"", 'Dark Side of the Moon relies heavily on sounds made possible by tape recording']","[[""It's Gonna Rain"", 'Steve Reich'], ['Music for 18 Musicians', 'Steve Reich'], ['In a Silent Way', 'Miles Davis'], ['Crossings', 'Herbie Hancock'], ['Music for Airports', 'Brian Eno'], ['Space Oddity', 'David Bowie'], ['The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars', 'David Bowie'], ['Dark Side of the Moon', 'Pink Floyd'], ['Wish You Were Here', 'Pink Floyd']]","Minimalist classical composers were on the cutting edge of music theory, utilizing phasing and other experimental techniques with tapes and phase shifting, looping, and syncing sounds.

Listen to this album a few times, and share your thoughts!  69 great love songs?  Lots of filler and a lot of gimmick?  Is there more depth to this album than most would think?  What is this album really remembered for? Why do you still listen to it after all these years/if this was your first time listening, did you enjoy it?  Please remember that this is *not* the place to give a number rating or a one word response.  

Thanks for joining in! I frequently list *69 Love Songs* as my favorite album.  I'd even argue that it's the single greatest concept album of all time.

In *69 Love Songs*, Stephin Merritt succeeds in taking you through every single emotion felt over a truly passionate relationship.  Because of flexibility he has due to the genre-hopping, he manages to match the musical emotion of each song to the precise lyrics.  A quick tour:

-[Asleep and Dreaming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJsK2mSUwnM) functions as a true love song.  It's lyrics reflect someone who's deeply and madly in love with somebody: ""You may not be beautiful/ but it's not for me to judge./ I don't know if you're beautiful/ because I love you too much.""  The classically romantic arrangement (provided by the author Lemony Snicket on this track, by the way) clearly reflects the lyrics here.

-[My Only Friend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otslu_0esKs) reflects a time when the loneliness of being single sets in.  You begin to look towards music to cope with your loneliness: ""Hey Lady Day, can you save my life today?""  The music is a wash of reverb and delay heavy piano tracks that completely envelop the listener.  The song immerses you in the music in the same way that the song's protagonist's music immerses him.

-[Absolutely Cuckoo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxyhCm_vTMc) (the first song on the album) captures the excited, yet still hesitant, feeling of meeting someone great.  It's got Merritt's sharp comedic edge ""Give me a week or two to/ 
Go absolutely cuckoo /
Then, when you see your error/
Then you can flee in terror.""
His music here perfectly reflects the excitement of falling in love with someone with his non-stop vocal delivery.  The recording is actually two takes of Stephin Merritt singing, alternating lines, because it's nearly impossible for one person to keep up with this song by them self.

I could go on for the other 66, as well, but I think you get the point.  This is an incredibly clever and complex album.  There are more than enough straight-up fantastic songs (Busbey Berkeley Dreams, Grand Canyon, The Book of Love, Papa was a Rodeo, All My Words, I Don't Want to Get Over You) to carry the intimidated listener through this 3-hour monster.  Once you get deep enough into it, you'll want to completely immerse yourself in Merritt's world of strong melodies and bitingly true lyrics.

I just saw them live the other night, it's incredible how simplistic the foundation for most of his songs are (ranging from 2 to 4 basic chords strummed for 5 to 10 minutes), yet he manages to add layers upon layers to create something much more complex...if that isn't a representation of what the human spirit is about, I don't know what is.

Lyrically, can you get anymore hopelessly optimistic?  This is music for deadbeats, music that inspires people who have ever considered completely removing themselves from society.  Singing about heroin, and existentialism is flawlessly paired with gospel choirs and strings.  ""Jesus"", ""God"", and the ""lord"" all play heavy roles, but that's just on the surface level...I'm not thinking about religion when he's crying for salvation, I see it as taking those words back from religion but still acknowledging a force that's greater than ourselves.

If you've never looked deep into their catalog, start with ""Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space"".  This is not my favorite, but it's the best representation of their career.  If you'd like more of the same, move onto ""Pure Phase"" or ""Sweet Heart, Sweet Light"".  If you loved the gospel/orchestral heavy tracks like 'Cool Waves' listen to ""Let It Come Down"" next.  If you're into the more bluesy tracks like 'Electricity', follow up with the albums ""Amazing Grace"" and ""A&amp;E"".  If you loved the dreamy state of 'Stay With Me', pick up (my personal favorite) ""Lazer Guided Melodies"".

In that I propose a ""Rate the song above you"" 'thread'. Usually found on forums and usually existent in a completely chaotic manner this would work, I think, to expand people's minds if done properly and moderated properly. I think this specific community is mature enough to handle it. A few rules I propose:

**1**) When rating a song someone has linked you must include some kind of textual criticism/observation of the song you've just heard.

**2**) No rating/reviewing of any song you, yourself have heard. Or even in a genre you're intricately familiar with. Let someone else who might not be familiar try it.

**3**) No rating/reviewing of any song in a style of music that you know you really dislike.

**4**) No spamming/domineering the thread by being every single other poster.

**5**) You must rate and review a song for every song you post. 

**6**) Obviously this will function by replying to each linked song. This will result in, unfortunately extraordinarily long comment threads. A limit of say 10+ replies could be implemented? When you are the last in that comment thread you could reply with your rating and mini-review and then start a new comment thread, linking your last reply to it.

Perhaps there could be several comment threads going at once each with different emphasis on styles. Any thoughts?

Edit: Added Proposal #3

Edit 2: Added Proposal #5 It surprised me! The subtle guitars and synth at the beginning were making me think ""Sigur Ros"", and I was thinking it was a bit generic, but as it went on, instruments layered one on another, and it began to sound like half Explosions in the Sky and half Cap'n Jazz.

I am obsessed with it right now because of how it defies my western sensibilities. I only have VERY basic understanding of western music theory, so I can't describe what it is about this song that blows my mind. Any opinion, i think, would help me understand! 


IE is there a name for the kinds of chords/sonorities going on? what the hell kind of melody is that, why is it so long and unpredictable? how much of it is improvised? is there a name for the song structure? what key is it? what are the notes in the scale it uses? what language is it even?


All I can say for sure at this point, it has a pretty typical highlife rhythm. Any comments on the Highlife ""genre"" are also welcome.


I welcome any opinion, analysis, thoughts on the song that you care to offer:

please note that the song is long as hell but for the most part stays the same, don't feel obliged to listen all the way through thanks! I have listened to a lot of highlife and afrobeat, some soukous, but what I'm most interested in is Highlife (baby steps lol - its a big continent!). No matter how much i listen though, I feel like I'm missing some deeper understanding of it. I lack the terminology to be able to break it down. if you ever post that cyclophony diagram, or any other diagrams that would help me understand highlife, i'll give u reddit gold.

Composers such as Debussy, Ravel, and Satie are often categorized together as Impressionists, although all three of the ones I've mentioned rejected the term. Now, it's easy to see why someone would group them together. They all originated from roughly the same time period and to the untrained ear, their music does sound similar. In fact, they often used a lot of the same techniques (i.e. influences from non-European cultures). However, through further analysis of their works, you see that they're just as different as they are similar.

Personally, I don't think it's a genre. What do you think? They definitely had impressionistic pieces - that is to say pieces that were musical representations of otherwise real/tangible things.  This sort of realism and sense of clarity is also a large part of what impressionistic painters concerned themselves with.  However, in music, many people end up just using the word to misrepresent the entirety of the composers' catalogs, and ultimately, the *musical*/theoretical aspects that define their music - nebulous moods, departure from traditional forms, sudden shifts in style mid-piece (moreso a Debussy thing than the others, a unique tonal language (although Debussy and Ravel had different tonal languages, they shared some similarities), so on and so forth.  You play a bunch of whole-tone and pentatonic scales on the piano, and somebody will go ""that sounds impressionistic"".  How so?  That's the *opposite* of impressionistic - as a piece of artwork, it holds no basis in reality.

In terms of musical style, I'd characterize earlier Debussy as late romantic, and late Debussy, Ravel and Satie to an extent, as being post-romantic - none of them is strictly atonal, but all of them do challenge and stretch the boundaries of tonality, which is a defining characteristic of ""contemporary"" and early 20th-century music.  But I do think ""impressionism"" as a descriptor for musical pieces is valid when used appropriately.  For the sake of exemplification - Debussy's [La Mer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDZ9dodpOx0) is an impressionistic piece.  [Estampes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxnZ0fqwey0) is an impressionistic piece.  Ravel's [Miroirs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj5JxtVXMus) is impressionistic.  Ravel's [String Quartet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVVONYkivM) is not impressionistic.

**Summary**

Characterised by their mix of folk rock, sunshine pop, and psychedelia, the Lovin' Spoonful formed in Greenwich Village in 1965, which, at the time, played host to many musicians such as the Mamas and the Papas, the Velvet Underground, Simon and Garfunkel, and Bob Dylan. 

Achieving nine top 20 singles in the US (of those, 7 top 10s, including Summer In The City, which went to no.1 in August 1966) and two top 10 UK singles, the Lovin' Spoonful were at the forefront of the American folk music revival of the mid-1960s with bands like the Mamas and Papas, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan and the Byrds. 

However, they were not heavily based in the lyrics of Bob Dylan, as many acts at the time were. Instead, they portrayed a kind of imagery that the Beach Boys were known for using: innocent, child-like, and romantic, differing from the social commentary that Dylan inspired. 

Led by John Sebastian, who wrote most of their songs, the band dissolved after he left in 1968, partly due to a drugs bust that had damaged the band earlier. They can be compared to the Kinks in a way - although they had several hits their time, they were mostly overshadowed by bands like the Byrds, and were never really that popular in the UK. 

Yet they were a catalyst for the segue from folk to psychedelic rock in the US, and were an inspiration for sunshine pop and psychedelic charm in the 1960s. Sexy old blues song? John Hurt - [Coffee Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXfcou4Qo7Y)

What hurts a soundtrack? What are the best/worst soundtracks? I think a good soundtrack is more than just the appropriate motif, theme, or sound fitting into the appropriate scene or film. I think that a good soundtrack needs to stand up on its own as a good compilation as well.

What comes to mind immediately is the *Cruel Intentions* soundtrack, which from the title sequence, to the only other Marcy Playground song I can name, to the Counting Crows, to the Verve at the end, fits together not only as a very strong representation of alternative music in the late 90s, but fits the overall, underlying sinister and cynical tone of the film itself. I would say that that is an amazing soundtrack. 

Another soundtrack that does the same is the *Donnie Darko* soundtrack, which is very 80s, and from Echo, to the Church, Joy Division, and ""Mad World"", the tone of that film is aptly represented by the music. 

One soundtrack I do not like is the *Singles* soundtrack. Now, as a compilation, it holds together well as an amazing sampling of 90s music, but doesn't really fit the plot of the film, which itself feels like a very contrived movie. I don't like the *I Am Sam* soundtrack either, because it seems like a forced gimmick to have a bunch of Beatles covers to compliment such a contrived, over-emotional garbage bag, and the covers (for the most part) blow ass.  at least back in the CD era, soundtracks were reliable top sellers. it was semi-controversial because arguably they were cannibalizing sales of actual albums by staying at the top of the charts.

 According to last.fm, here are the 5 artists I listened to the most for the past month:

**[Danny Brown - ""XXX""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgCU3rC6tqU)**

If you're into hip-hop and never heard Danny Brown, then please stop what you're doing and go listen to him right fuckin now. There's no one out there who's quite like Danny. His voice may be tough to get used to at first, but he's an amazing lyricist, and this album goes through a weird range of emotions. It's a concept album that deals with drugs, sex, partying, excess, depression, and suicide. 

**[Kanye West - ""The College Dropout,"" ""Late Registration""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG35jDkaQg0)**

I'm fairly certain you're all familiar with Kanye so I probably don't need to say much about him, but I consider all his albums to be classics (yes guys, even Graduation). And these first two albums are pretty much his only straightforward hip-hop albums. They're chock full of humor, sadness, and the ""sped-up soul"" style production that Kanye would become famous for.

**[Hüsker Dü - ""Zen Arcade""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTjfl0yhyRk)**

Classic alternative punk/post-punk record from 1984. I believe it's a concept album about a guy who runs away from home. This album just has this midwestern vibe that make you think of both suburbs and factories. In my opinion, there's never been and probably never will be a band quite like Hüsker Dü, and ""Zen Arcade"" is their magnum opus. (Fun Fact: It was released the same day as another classic SST album; Minutemen's ""Double Nickels on the Dime."")

**[The Blood Brothers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfdjOqoshxI)**

I listened to a bunch of their albums so I didn't name a specific one, but they were a phenomenal experimental post-hardcore act out of Seattle, Washington. If you wanna get into these guys, take everything you thought you knew about post-hardcore and dump it out of your brain, because you'll never hear anything quite like what these guys were doing. It's a shame they broke up.

**[James Blake - ""Overgrown""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aNRCoOsWb8)**

James Blake is a British singer-songwriter/producer who mixes so-called ""post-dubstep"" with strange samples and some of the most beautiful vocals I've ever heard out of a grown man. I'm a straight guy, but I'd make sweet sweet love to James Blake if I was given the chance. And his new album certainly lives up to the expectations that his self-titled debut raised, although some critics don't think so.

Saåad - *Delayed Summer*

guitar/synth drone that is powerful but always just beyond grasp.  That is, it isn't tangible and physical like drone metal.  The sounds are weak and layered and together gain their strength, with that amount of sound it is hard to tell what hazey, silvery sounds are gracefully slipping in and out of the mix.  

Music for staring at the wake of the boat on a day so foggy you can't see the shore.

Brass Bed -- *This Secret Will Keep You*  

Blurb: This Lafayette, LA band just released this new album last week and I've found it really interesting thus far. It's a blend of some more traditional power pop and rock with some ambitious structures, melodies and instrumentation. For example, the song [Back and Forth](http://www.last.fm/music/Brass+Bed/_/Back+And+Forth) starts with 30 seconds of ambient noise, shifts into a pretty straight laced guitar pop song, then has a heavy breakdown that shows up a couple of different times over the course of the song.",Back and Forth,Brass Bed,85.7142857142857,83.3333333333333,"['traditional power pop and rock blend', 'ambitious structures', 'melodies', 'instrumentation', '30 seconds of ambient noise', 'straight laced guitar pop', 'heavy breakdown']",[],[],['interesting'],,,"[['Back and Forth', 'Brass Bed']]","Blend of traditional power pop and rock with ambitious structures, melodies, and instrumentation.

Do you like them or can you not stand them? What are your favorite albums/songs of theirs? What do you think of their current direction and where do you think they'll go next?

 Personally, the only album of theirs that I can listen to cover to cover is *Merriweather Post Pavilion*, and at that I have to skip ""Lion in a Coma"" because it's too grating.

They strike me as a band that knows its niche but hasn't embraced it. The songs of theirs that really shine off that album are the incredibly melodic, dreamy ones like ""Bluish"", ""My Girls"", and ""In the Flowers"". That's what they're good at, big songs backed by a strong melody.

Oh Darling is certainly louder, with a more desperate tone to it, with loud vocals and ska-like guitar backing. Like Come Together, it's very bluesy, yet the distorted guitar, swung rhythm, and soulful singing makes the song rockier than the opener.

Octopus' Garden, in tone and form, is a departure from Oh Darling. I find it bear similarities to Maxwell's Silver Hammer, due to the upbeat rhythm and form, and Because, due to the harmonies in the verse. Yet the track has the fastest tempo on side 1.

 I had the pleasure of running across Animal Collective playing in some weird open area in between a couple of buildings at SXSW in 2006. I was riding by on my bike, and I stopped dead in my tracks just to listen to them and it was amazing. I had listened to them a little bit before, but only Sung Tongs and Feels. It was an amazing show and wish I hadn't just caught it in the middle.

For me, I don't really care for a lot of their earlier stuff, but a song like Bat You'll Fly really stands out to me as the odd sounding poppy type stuff they'd come to make later.

I enjoy a good bit of Here Comes the Indian, but I really enjoy most of everything that they've come out with after. There are a couple of songs that seem to me lackluster/slow/boring, but I still enjoy from time to time.

Listening to the beginning of Peacebone still gives me chills, and For Reverend Green is great. Strawberry Jam is probably my favorite album.

 sure, I like them. they're probably easily one of my 4 or 5 favorite bands.

favorite albums? uh.. Merriweather Post Pavilion, Strawberry Jam, Fall Be Kind EP, Feels, Sung Tongs, Water Curses EP, Here Comes the Indian, Spirit They've Gone.. probably roughly in that order.

I think they have evolved incredibly well. it's not even really a question. I mean, they started out with some pretty heavily abstract, experimental, noisy stuff, and then sort of got heavily psychedelic pop, and have since branched into some sort of mix of that sound with some serious dance music. it's crazy, and it's all great.

Peer pressure sort of got the best of me as it can with anyone in Jr. high school and I always saw them as an emo-trend boy band of sorts.

Starting about six months ago, I decided to give them a chance based on some of their newer music, and realized albums were actually pretty solid. When you get past the radio singles, there's a lot of depth in the lyrics of their older work, along with quite a bit of instrument variation,  which made their first two album pretty refreshing to me.

It just kind of hit me that six or seven years ago I refused to listen to them because every other girl in my school seemed mystified by I Write Sins not Tragedies and other guys thought the band was stupid, and I kind of followed suit. What are some other bands that seem to have this trend, or you overlooked? Skrillex. He's put out so many incredible tunes, yet everyone seems to look over them because his fanbase is mostly annoying middle schoolers.

Contrary to popular belief, the majority of his songs are not dubstep. He produces with a relatively wide range of EDM styles, although most of the fans just want SMANS rehashes (""FILTHY DROP D00D!!!).

He's also a very talented producer. All of his songs are cleanly mastered and are technically complex. Many of his songs take seemingly random noises and turns them into beautiful melodies (see: With You Friends).

Check out Slats, Make Things For Smile, and Summit. I highly encourage looking past Skrillex's largely immature fanbase, because there's a lot of good music to be found.

I was thinking about what’s in regular rotation on pop radio in my area and Imagine Dragons came to mind; their debut single was “It’s Time”, a mostly handclapped percussion song with a driving mandolin, vocal harmonies and a fair amount of piano. Their follow-up single, “Radioactive” almost sounds like an entirely different band. In fact, if you listen to their record they have a few tracks that borderline on a “world” music sound. It’s a little all over the map. 

What are some other examples you call can think of for bands that are popular in the mainstream right now that don’t necessarily have “one” sound, and moreover, do you agree that radio tends to popularize and perpetuate bands that write the same thing over and over again?
 I wouldn't go so far to call them mainstream, however The Flaming Lips have changed their sound tremendously over their career. Their newest album is nothing like Yoshimi, which is very different from the mid to early 90s music. Very rarely do you expect that type of progression.

Another non-mainstream example would be Cloud Nothings. They went for a beach rock lo-fi band to a hardcore behemoth in the span of one album.

Some are cautionary tales, some not so much. My point is this - it's an incredibly difficult subject and yet it has been the inspiration for so many great songs. So... Let's talk music. Anyone want to have a go? [Herbie Hancock - Vein Melter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G_drozlrW4)


&gt;Vein melter is a short story told in musical form by a genius. It is an insight into heroin abuse. It starts with the addict’s heartbeat and a short, chirpy refrain which probably represents the addict’s satisfaction at scoring. Then comes a clash - that is the hit. His heartbeat becomes louder and more pronounced now and we witness the effect the drug has on the user. The high is expressed by some of the most beautuful, exquisite jazz you will ever hear. It is poignant because the only way this person can experience beauty in his life is by using this drug. As the gorgeous high goes on however, the music becomes crazy and disjointed like the junkie’s outlook on life, and then Hancock manages to express his pity and great sorrow for this person’s plight. The high fades away as the effects of the drug wear off and harsh reality returns, the heartbeat returns to normal, leaving the tragic addict right back where he started. This incredible experience has been totally pointless. He is left with absolutely nothing, except a need for more.
Herbie Hancock is a grande master of his instument.

Anyone want to have a go? VU's 'Heroin,' no contest. I like many of the tunes mentioned here, but they're about heroin lyrically. I find that in 'Heroin, the music itself embodies heroin use, not that I know personally. It's an exemplary instance of lyrics and music working together to express meaning. The alteration of calm and frenzy mirrors the experience of shooting up. You have the blissful guitar strums, but always on top of the subtle, menacing drone (which I see as the addiction) in the background, which is revealed after the other instruments fade out (after the drug wears off). You have the thumping drum hits, mimicking an accelerating heart beat, continually waxing and waning, eventually leading towards a cacophony, before resolving. A lot like ""chasing the dragon,"" continually seeking a return to the original euphoria, which i see represented fully in this closing, explosive section of the song.

I was thinking about what’s in regular rotation on pop radio in my area and Imagine Dragons came to mind; their debut single was “It’s Time”, a mostly handclapped percussion song with a driving mandolin, vocal harmonies and a fair amount of piano. Their follow-up single, “Radioactive” almost sounds like an entirely different band. In fact, if you listen to their record they have a few tracks that borderline on a “world” music sound. It’s a little all over the map. 

What are some other examples you call can think of for bands that are popular in the mainstream right now that don’t necessarily have “one” sound, and moreover, do you agree that radio tends to popularize and perpetuate bands that write the same thing over and over again?
 Boris does a fair amount of genre hopping.

Poor old Baroque is stuck in the wilderness somewhere and is trying to avoid getting eaten by wild bears so I am going to post this one even though I had previously disavowed myself of all responsibility for these kinds of things. 

We are going to waffle on about White Denim's superb album D which I listened to and really liked. It seems to have a bit of everything from rough funky punky rock to a sort of Pink Floydy swirly, thick and gooey thing. 

The main thing I liked is that it has the right balance of natural, raw *music-being-played-in-a-room-by-musicians*ness and production spit &amp; polish.  

I usually dislike new stuff, I more or less think modern popular music died after Saturday Night Fever ran its course so to enjoy this album was a great surprise for me. 

Give it a listen [here](http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/LTM+Album+Club+number+2+White+Denim+D/68504892) and tell us all what you think about it.  I've been listening to this throughout the week, and I've really liked it. Some things I liked/disliked about it:

* These guys are good at their instruments. I really liked all the complex guitar work throughout the album, particularly the stuff in unorthodox time signatures (""River to Consider"", the end of ""Bess St.""). Even when it felt like they were just dicking around, it was still fun to listen to. 

* I really liked the singer's voice. It's just the right amount of ""different"" to be interesting but still accessible. 

* Like OP said, there's a bit of everything on here. I like that there's a good amount of variety of styles but it still sounds cohesive.

* Some of the instrumental passages seemed like they went on for too long. ""At The Farm"" in particular doesn't really do much for me. I can appreciate it's place in the sequence of the album, but it just falls flat for me for some reason. 

I'd give it an 8/10 overall.

I can listen to Tool for a very long time, the time signatures and phrasing between bass/drums interest me... but I realize many people don't share this viewpoint.

What are your thoughts on Tool? Any album you like/hate in particular? Which instrument do you consider the ""focus"" of the music?  Do you like their image or think they're a bunch of pretentious fucks? Are you interested or bored by their sound? Prison Sex has one of the most disturbing and amazing music videos I've ever seen. Its a haunting visual masterpiece. 

Regarding the focus of their music; for a long time I felt that, while I liked any given Tool song put before me, many of the songs almost idled. For instance, take the main riff in any of Prison Sex, Schism, Sober. My initial response to all any of these was a feeling of droning repetition. Initially this didn't appeal to me. It took me some time to appreciate the instrumentation on a broader spectrum. As I continued to listen to Tool the lens I began to frame their music in was much closer to how I viewed and appreciate post-rock, more as a sonic landscape than a series of musical phrases. Under this lens my enjoyment of the band increased considerably. They've never been my absolute favorite band by any means, but certainly as my view of their music changed so increased my appreciation for their work.",Prison Sex,Tool,66.6666666666666,80.0,"['time signatures and phrasing between bass/drums', 'droning repetition', 'sonic landscape']","['musical content of 10,000 Days compares to earlier offerings', ""viewed and appreciate Tool's music akin to post-rock""]",[],"['haunting visual masterpiece', 'droning repetition', 'sonic landscape']",,,"[['10,000 Days', 'Tool'], ['Prison Sex', 'Tool'], ['Schism', 'Tool'], ['Sober', 'Tool']]","The sonic landscape is characterized by time signatures and phrasing between bass and drums, creating a droning repetition.

My more personalized (and niche) list for the best of the 00s:

* The Knife - Deep Cuts: This has come to define electronic music w/ vocals for me. It's so instantly recognizable &amp; weird yet remains very catchy and poppish.

* Ladytron - Velocifero: One thing that did repeat for me this decade was a love for new stylized synthpop and I think Ladytron did this by far the best. Not really sure Velocifero is their best album but it will probably be their most recognizable.

* HTRK - Marry Me Tonight: I have never heard an album ooze melancholy like this and do it so beautifully. The only thing I can think to compare them to is Sonic Youth but that seems to do both bands disservice.

* Clint Mansell &amp; Mogwai - The Foutain: The timing was just right for a composer and post rock band to work together to create something beautiful, I'm rather surprised this recipe hasn't been repeated more often.

* The Kills - *anything*: The garage rock revival we saw earlier in the decade never lived up to it's potential for me, at least not until I got around to listening to The Kills.

* Saltillo - Ganglion: One of the last great gasps from the trip-hop genre. Incredible combination of instrumentation, beats, and recordings.

* Kashiwa Daisuke - Program Music I: If there was ever an album to put headphones on for and have a religious moment to, this is it.

* NASA - The Spirit of Apollo: Well, I said some mean things about having some token rap music and this is mine. Besides being an amazing album it also feels like a bookend to what hip-hop sounded like for an era.

* Fever Ray - Fever Ray: It feels like a dam broke sometime in the late 00s and every girl with a dark side and a love for electronic music started putting out albums, this was just one of my favorites.

* Eyedea &amp; Ablities - By the Throat: I think another thing the 00s really showed was that it was quite possible to combine indie/rock music with rap and not get Limp Bizkit. Fantastic album lyrically and instrumentally.

* Amon Tobin - Supermodified: This was like the gunshot that started off the whole genre of IDM and eventually EDM for me. There are two genres that will really come to define the 00s for me: IDM &amp; Post-Rock.

* God is an Astronaut - All if Violent, All is Bright: This is kind of a placemarker for your post-rock album of choice. This happens to be my personal favorite but there are dozens you could pick from that are probably more worthy (Mogwai, GSY!BE, &amp; Explosions in the Sky seem to be the obvious choices).

My primary interest is in psychedelic rock, and that realm has been very active so far this century... Not so much psychedelic in the way that Animal Collective or Phish are -- more like The Black Angels or Sigur Ros. Let's see...

The Black Angels - *Passover* (2006) -- still their best

Black Mountain - *Black Mountain* (2004) -- still their best

Primal Scream - *Evil Heat* (2002) -- Possibly their most consistent Primal Scream album ever. Love how they continue to reinvent themselves, although albums subsequent to this have been sub-par. They've always been spotty, but when they're good, they're fucking great, and *Evil Heat* is their least spotty record.

Calla - *Televise* (2003) -- this band does not make bad records -- too bad they stopped making records.

A Place To Bury Strangers - *Exploding Head* (2009) -- intense.

Brian Jonestown Massacre - *Bravery, Repetition and Noise* (2001), *...And This Is Our Music* (2003), *My Bloody Underground* (2008), *Who Killed Sgt. Pepper?* (2010)

Black Rebel Motorcycle Club - entire discography.

The Entrance Band - *Prayer of Death* (2006) - WOW

The Lovetones - *Lost* -- Matthew Tow (the songwriter from this band) gives Lennon/McCartney a run for their money in terms of songwriting chops. ZOW!

Psychic TV - *Hell is Invisible... Heaven is Her/e* (2007) - awesome record.

Sigur Ros - *()* (2002) is one of my favorites of theirs. possibly the best live band of all time, as evidenced by [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQsPv4FMyLg)

Super Furry Animals - *Dark Days, Light Years* (2009) -- amazing. this band is always amazing. One of the most original and creative bands ever. Gruff Rhys, the frontman, is a genius.

The Church - *Forget Yourself* (2004) -- one of the most prolific groups of all time. Consistently good records going back to 1981. *Forget Yourself* is one of their best. Dark, moody, psychedelic, subtle, heavy at times, dreamy at times... amazing lyrics...

Dead Skeletons - *Dead Magick* (ok this came out in 2011, but it's SO GOOD) - [stream it here](http://www.dead.is/deadskeletons.html)

The Warlocks - *Rise and Fall* (2001)

Death From Above 1979 - *You're a Woman, I'm a Machine* -- raw power

White Noise Sound - *WNS* (came out in 2010, does that count?)

Tara Angell - *Come Down* (2005) -- great singer/songwriter, opiated, Faithfull-esque tunes with very imaginative/creative arrangements. 

Nine Inch Nails - *With Teeth* (2005), *Year Zero* (2007) -- one of my favorite bands of all time, can do no wrong

k-os - *Exit* (2002), *Atlantis: Hymns for Disco* (2006) - one of the best, most soulful rappers alive. Can do any style of music. Reggae, rock, R&amp;B/soul, conscious hip-hop, funk... everything. He sings, he raps, he plays guitar. Amazing.

Radiohead - *Kid A* (*Amnesiac* was pretty good, too, but I would only consider *Kid A* to be a favorite)

Autolux - *Future Perfect* (2004) -- amazing record!!

Air - *The Virgin Suicides* (2000), *10,000 Hz Legend* (2001) (subsequent albums have been good but they are all starting to sound the same)

Flavor Crystals - *Ambergris* (2007) - amazingly dreamy, slow psych

Grinderman - both records are incredible.


The list goes on... Moon Duo, Singapore Sling, The Soft Moon, The Soundtrack of Our Lives, Joseph Arthur, Telltale, Ulrich Schnauss, Weird Owl, White Hills, The Paperhead, Minutes til Midnight, Magic Mirror, Lumerians, La Fleur Fatale, The Flying Eyes, Hopewell, Dragontears, DarkDriveClinic, Asteroid #4, The Blue Angel Lounge, Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, Dolly Rocker Movement, Adam Franklin &amp; Bolts of Melody, Dead Meadow... it's ridiculous how much good music has come out in the last 12 years.

I also quite enjoyed LCD Soundsystem but they're not my *favorite.* *Stankonia* is a pretty good Outkast album, and certain songs on *Speakerboxxx/The Love Below* are amazing, but *Aquemini* is still my favorite.

First, [**""Lucky"" by Supercar**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFLuZubqizI)
*note: cheesy intro*

This is the first song that came to my mind when I asked myself this question, they're a great shoegaze band from Japan. It's the first song that introduced me to shoegaze back in high school. 

When I first heard this song, I'm pretty sure that my eyes quite literally widened, my mouth opened, and I was thinking, ""this is perfect."" I can't exactly place the reason for my reaction, it was my first time having such a positive/emotional reaction to such a...non-emotional song/performance? Saying that is incorrect, I know, but I'm not sure how to word it. However, I believe that's the goal in shoegaze. But to be completely honest, I don't get near the same feeling anymore from it. I still really enjoy it, but it probably wouldn't make into a top ten. If I go a long enough time without listening to it, and come back to it, like I did today, it comes close. The first listen though, that was a feeling of awe.


Second, [**""E"" by Spangle Call Lilli Line**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e6C8gEUzQ4)

This is from a similar Japanese shoegaze band called Spangle Call Lilli Line. I never expected to get the same feeling as I did from Lucky, from another song within the same genre. That's also part of the reason why I find I like it more than Lucky. The ""this is perfect"" feeling hit me at the 2:00 minute mark and onward. The song, like Lucky, gives me my moment of zen, I guess. The difference is, I can always come back to this, and...it just does it for me. Like for a lot of people, nostalgia is a moderately weighty emotion, and this song gives me a good dose of it while also allowing me to look out the window and just enjoy the moment. Like, ""the past was great, but take a look around and realize that the present has just as much to offer"". The sad thing, I have no idea what the song is actually about. That's not important to me though, as much as that may make a forehead vein bulge for some of you. ha

I could easily post more and branch into other genres, but let's keep it at two. Besides, I'm tired of typing.

I guess I'll answer it before it's asked. If not obvious by my previous statement, I don't know Japanese at all, and I find that I enjoy songs more if I don't understand the language. It's something I realized not too long ago. I used to ask people, ""how the hell do you remember entire songs?"" Then the, ""duh"" moment...they actually listen to the lyrics. I don't know, I don't listen to them, and I rarely find myself caring to. Of course, all the time, I'll get catchy choruses stuck in my head and sing them all day. But more often than not, I hear the vocals as just another instrument. There is one exception, ""Swing Life Away"" from Rise Against, I can probably recite 95% of that song because it's the song I used to learn, miserably, how to play the guitar. Pretty much all of ""Blood on the Tracks"", but specifically **Tangled Up In Blue** and/or **If You See Her, Say Hello** -- both have FANTASTIC conveyance of utter heartbreak mixed with a beautiful folky ""real story"" feel, which is emphasized by Dylan's voice -- he doesn't pretty up that misery in any shape or form.

On a exact-same note, ""Grace"" by Jeff Buckley, specifically **Lover, You Should Have Come Over** and **Last Goodbye** for the same reasons, except his guitar style is different enough to be the exact distinct ""something new"" I was looking for when I discovered it.","If You See Her, Say Hello",Bob Dylan,77.7777777777777,71.4285714285714,"['shoegaze', 'emotional reaction to non-emotional song', 'nostalgia', 'vocals as an instrument', 'fantastic conveyance of utter heartbreak', 'folky real story feel', 'distinct guitar style']","[""Supercar's Lucky introduced shoegaze"", 'Spangle Call Lilli Line gives the same feeling as Supercar', 'Tangled Up In Blue and If You See Her, Say Hello have similar conveyance of heartbreak', 'Grace by Jeff Buckley offers a distinct something new']",[],"['feeling of awe', 'moment of zen', 'nostalgia with present appreciation', 'good dose of nostalgia', 'enjoying moments with window gazing']",,,"[['Lucky', 'Supercar'], ['E', 'Spangle Call Lilli Line'], ['Tangled Up In Blue', 'Bob Dylan'], ['If You See Her, Say Hello', 'Bob Dylan'], ['Grace', 'Jeff Buckley'], ['Lover, You Should Have Come Over', 'Jeff Buckley'], ['Last Goodbye', 'Jeff Buckley'], ['Swing Life Away', 'Rise Against']]","Utter heartbreak mixed with a beautiful folky ""real story"" feel"

There is one exception, ""Swing Life Away"" from Rise Against, I can probably recite 95% of that song because it's the song I used to learn, miserably, how to play the guitar. Basically, the whole Kindred EP by Burial. It wasn’t so much the sound I was looking for as it was the sound I didn’t know I wanted. 

Before that, I had his popular album, Untrue, sitting in my collection for some time just because I’ve seen it recommended by so many people way too many times. I listened to it, and literally fell asleep like five or six tracks in. 

Some time later someone on /mu/ posted a link to Kindred and I decided to check it out. Thankfully I did because those 30 minutes and those three tracks completely blew my mind and opened my eyes to everything new and interesting within the electronic genre. 

The BOOM BOOM! KLACK KLACK! on the [title track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC16FJTI6XM) was unlike anything I’ve ever heard, and I loved it. The [second track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLD3yGEZDDk) was pretty great as well, but the third and final track, [Ashtray Wasp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=555XMqqDYtU), became my favorite song for quite a while. It has three different movements and the transitions, development and vocal samples within each are just expertly done.

There are now a ton of Burial copy cats out there, and I’ve listened to a lot of them. I can’t find anything that even compares. I don’t think it will be long until I do, though. The whole “future garage” and post-dubstep scene is producing some of the most interesting music out there right now.

And on the topic of Japanese shoegaze, I would recommend the album Sashitai by 百蚊. It includes both male and female vocals (the female does a much better job in my opinion), and it's my favorite release from 2006, but it’s not as catchy as anything you posted.

I guess I'll answer it before it's asked. If not obvious by my previous statement, I don't know Japanese at all, and I find that I enjoy songs more if I don't understand the language. It's something I realized not too long ago. I used to ask people, ""how the hell do you remember entire songs?"" Then the, ""duh"" moment...they actually listen to the lyrics. I don't know, I don't listen to them, and I rarely find myself caring to. Of course, all the time, I'll get catchy choruses stuck in my head and sing them all day. But more often than not, I hear the vocals as just another instrument. There is one exception, ""Swing Life Away"" from Rise Against, I can probably recite 95% of that song because it's the song I used to learn, miserably, how to play the guitar. The first real foray I had into the music I listen too was with Evanescence's *Fallen* album, so that's probably the biggest, most obvious moment you speak of for me as it's what's gotten me into almost all of my Symphonic Metal.

Since, I've had many of those moments. The first time I ever heard Epica's [Design your Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-yWUMjSwZI), I was quite intrigued. How they managed to combine almost progressive death metal while retaining a chamber-orchestra classical feel was quite impressive to me and the're on my top few lists of favorite artists. Definitely the first time I heard [Voodoo mon Amour by Diablo Swing Orchestra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2mZVOd0jWY), it was the first time I'd ever heard jazz/swing combined with metal effectively. Basically all of that album is a goldmine.

Lately, I've been into more experimental stuff. It took a few listens, but much of Gorgut's *Obscura* between their use of eight-tone scales and  extremely jarring rhythms  is quite impressive. Particularly their use of dynamics and changing time signatures in [Nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnV62xxrL_A), I mean they just barely changed an eighth note in the switch to clean tone and you hardly notice it yet it changes the entire feel of the riff. Just tonight I had that moment with Blotted Science's [Cretaceous Chasm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKkn-YjYmCA). Transitioning time signatures with serialism in metal?

First, [**""Lucky"" by Supercar**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFLuZubqizI)
*note: cheesy intro*

This is the first song that came to my mind when I asked myself this question, they're a great shoegaze band from Japan. It's the first song that introduced me to shoegaze back in high school. 

When I first heard this song, I'm pretty sure that my eyes quite literally widened, my mouth opened, and I was thinking, ""this is perfect."" I can't exactly place the reason for my reaction, it was my first time having such a positive/emotional reaction to such a...non-emotional song/performance? Saying that is incorrect, I know, but I'm not sure how to word it. However, I believe that's the goal in shoegaze. But to be completely honest, I don't get near the same feeling anymore from it. I still really enjoy it, but it probably wouldn't make into a top ten. If I go a long enough time without listening to it, and come back to it, like I did today, it comes close. The first listen though, that was a feeling of awe.


Second, [**""E"" by Spangle Call Lilli Line**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e6C8gEUzQ4)

This is from a similar Japanese shoegaze band called Spangle Call Lilli Line. I never expected to get the same feeling as I did from Lucky, from another song within the same genre. That's also part of the reason why I find I like it more than Lucky. The ""this is perfect"" feeling hit me at the 2:00 minute mark and onward. The song, like Lucky, gives me my moment of zen, I guess. The difference is, I can always come back to this, and...it just does it for me. Like for a lot of people, nostalgia is a moderately weighty emotion, and this song gives me a good dose of it while also allowing me to look out the window and just enjoy the moment. Like, ""the past was great, but take a look around and realize that the present has just as much to offer"". The sad thing, I have no idea what the song is actually about. That's not important to me though, as much as that may make a forehead vein bulge for some of you. ha

**Album:** Love Songs for the Apocalypse 

**Specific Favorite Songs:** [Election Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfGdWn-pIjs), [Whiskey is my kind of Lullaby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVJZAwUBrX8),  [I Want Cancer for Christmas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeRrS-o7twk)

At first glance, the band might seem childish with unnecessarily harsh and biting lyrics, but when I first listened to their album I instantly fell in love. Their rough-around-the-edges punkish sound, fucked up but *so* honest and relevant lyrics attracts me like nothing else. This is probably due to the stuff that's been going on in my life that makes me want me to sniff pills and go hard because my expectations haven't been met. There have been so many days where I wonder how I can make my heart stop beating because my self-hate is too high. I can't count how many times I ran to a shot/line/pill to help me deal with it. I love everything about this band because their lyrics hit me to the core. Another artist whose music strings a chord in similar ways is Cranford Nix.

There was a topic about this album close to a month ago but now that it's actually being released I think another is appropriate. What do you think? I have to say I still miss the dreamier elements of Cryptograms and Microcastle but Deerhunter seems to have long since moved on. I'm a bigger fan of this abrasiveness than I was most things on Halcyon Digest, but there's not a lot separating this album from most garage rock since its revival in the 90's. Hell, the title track sounds almost like an outtake from Room on Fire until the shift about midway through. Back to the Middle is the standout to me right now, big fan of the little keyboard lines they've been sprinkling through their songs lately.

Also, what's Bradford Cox's deal lately? check out [this interview](http://news.radio.com/2013/04/04/deerhunters-bradford-cox-hates-morrissey-he-makes-me-want-to-wear-fur//) and how pretty much any time Cox was asked a question he'd tie it back to how much Morrissey sucks.

Cox has taken on an alter ego ""Connie Lungpin,"" which was on full display for Deerhunter's Fallon performance in early April (can't find a link; worth watching), which is interesting. I always thought Cox was enough of a character already. Is there a resurgence in the cross-dressing rock alter ego thing? I feel like I've seen it a lot lately. I liked ""Monomania"", but I've got to say- I really enjoyed ""Microcastle"" and ""Halcyon Digest"" more. I really liked the dreamy atmosphere that Deerhunter perfected on their previous two albums, and though I welcome their new garage rock influenced sound as an interesting change of pace, they certainly perfected what they were best at with ""Halcyon Digest"".

What I'm interested in, though, is the next **huge** thing, and whether or not it is possible to have another massive game changer in league with Dylan, The Beatles, Nirvana, etc. Or is present day music so fractioned and derivative* that we're not likely to see another culturally-impacting, super-widely revered, ""timeless"" act? Is there any wiggle room left for a brilliant, once-a-generation musician to make huge waves, or has everything been done? What do you predict?   
   
*When I say derivative, I understand that all music, including the three big names I mentioned, is derived from some amount of preceding music. But the cultural impact of these huge acts came from a proper mix of familiarly old and ingeniously new. Are there any new ideas left to mine? [There is plenty left to mine.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viMbnj_Ei2A)

Music doesn't get more complex over time, it just changes to reflect society and the feel of the current era. Plus, electronic music is relatively new- we haven't even really begun to explore what's possible.

Indie-folk/pop music is definitely something that is growing larger constantly. A couple years ago, if you played someone ""Hey Ho"" by the lumineers or ""Somebody that I used to know"" by Gotye and told them it's gonna be a radio hit, they'd call you retarded. What was once considered ""indie"" music is beginning to converge with what we considered pop music, this is something that's been happening slowly for almost half a decade now. ""Indie"" sounding bands are [getting more radio play recently](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvTqknDobU) and starting to incorporate more elements from mainstream music.

Aside from this, Daft Punk is currently stirring up [electronic/dance music.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I) The song is structurally simple, with four chords. (Not a bad thing- the blues is three chords and gave birth to almost every western genre of music that exists today.) Argue that it's not a good song all you want, but Daft Punk has a huge amount of musical authority (at least as far as EDM is concerned), the fact that they're releasing it and it *is* slightly different from what we normally hear (with a 70's disco vibe and [michael jackson-esque vocals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkCn-iWLiSE)) is enough reason for the song to carry quite a bit of weight/impact. If it were released by someone who holds weight in another genre of music, or an artist nobody knows about it probably wouldn't have much of an effect, but the nature of both Daft Punk and EDM (or just dance music in general, since I guess the song is technically not electronic.) makes a large difference. Things like this, as well as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuunY8BTqNs) make me think that we will see more electronic/dance-sounding bands using live instruments. They could just be a novelty as well though, there's no way of knowing.

We will probably have another game-changing musical act soon, but most people won't realize it until after the fact.

For me, it has to be Metallica hands down. I first got introduced to their early catalog (Kill 'em All-Master of Puppets) but after the Black Album, their studio material turned to utter shit. 

I've watched a ton of documentaries about Metallica and I think that the reason for this decline in quality of music originally started because of drug use/alcoholism as well as a loss of artistic integrity (Load and ReLoad were sort of their attempts at making ""pop"" albums) but in more recent years, their failures in the studio (Lulu, St. Anger) had to do with ego conflicts between James Hetfield, Kirk Hammet and Lars Ulrich (a lot of the footage of them recording Death Magnetic depicts them as being fairly condescending and disrespectful to each other). 

So what are some of your favorite bands that lost their way, and why do you think that shift in quality occurred?  They became an indie band, which is fine if you like to be bored.

Although my first reaction, like many others, was ""This is fantastic, however they have done this before"", I now don't think that is a particularly bad thing. Unlike previous efforts this is their first purely ballad based album, vs. their typical mix of anthematic rock and ballads. Although the move was quite obvious, especially going from Alligator to Boxer, I am not disappointed by it, as I was with Boxer upon my first listen.

On the first few listens, this album affects me much more differently. Unlike High Violet and Boxer, which were both heart breaking, Trouble Will Find Me ix. In many ways this reminds me of Take Care by Explosions in The Sky, where there previous efforts sounds like music to go into a battle, Take Care sounds like a soundtrack to the aftermath. Trouble Will Find Me (imho) has that same atmosphere to it: It is the calm after depression, the eye of a hurricane in many ways. You can't feel positive afterwards, but you also are not rattled like their previous efforts. 

On a completely separate note, the mastering on this album is leagues ahead of High Violet, which was one of the reasons I could never get into it. It is very clean, with some muddled effects, but nothing to the extent of HV, which felt very fake and off putting. 

What are your opinions on it?

  It sounds a lot like *High Violet* to me.  I agree that it definitely less muddled and depressed.  However, as on *High Violet*, the guitars generally eschew melody for texture, and the drumming is fairly relaxed.  I wish they would recapture some of the energy they had on Alligator and Boxer, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen at this point.  Song for song, it's probably their weakest album since *Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers*.  ""Don't Swallow the Cap"" is as good or better than anything on *High Violet*, but nothing else is notably good.

Since we are such a large musical mind as a community, it'd be interesting, I thought, to see which users can share information about much smaller, more esoteric or underground, genres or subgenres of music.

**If there is a subgenre of music you are particularly passionate about that you don't think this community has necessarily heard of, please post a summary, any insight into its history, and links to examples!** (Note I don't intend this to be a recommendation topic, more an enlightenment to lesser aspects of musical culture or history) My example would have to be **Grime**, a genre of underground music based mostly in London (UK) and in its peak from early-2002 until 2006/2007 (although it still continues as a genre today, this is simply my opinion of its heyday). The genre is essentially both Instrumental and MC based. The instrumental side of the genre can be characterised by heavy basslines, high tempos (often around 140 bpm), off beat kick drums, jittery/scattered cymbals and heavily emphasised snares. These qualities provide the skeleton, and the rest is often filled in with other instrumentation, samples, and a lot of the time, [gunshots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YYJL6Ypmxs).
Some examples include:

[DJ Oddz - Trouble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohz_K94whZA)

[DJ Charmzy - R-Ha](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1Cs9WOp4CI)

[Dizzee Rascal - Ho](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apqqdIifQeM)

[Alias - Warriors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsm6m_wTSuc)

[DJ Marsta - Gridlock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3YY3oSA6p8)

[Wiley - Igloo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Cl0H05WCg)

Then there's the vocal element. In the short time Grime was around, there were hundreds and hundreds of vocalists, the popular stuff and most famous stuff was dominated by a number of crews which include Roll Deep, NASTY Crew, Ruff Sqwad, Meridian Crew, East Connection, Slew Dem, etc etc, whic were often comprised of a couple DJs, a couple producers and a number of MCs. However, back in its heyday every kid at an inner city school thought they were the next big MC, had their own crew, exchanged tunes over bluetooth and made their own beats. The main exposure to Grime tunes came either through file sharing like this (at least for me) or through pirate radio. There were many large Pirate Radio stations in London including Rinse FM, Deja Vu FM, Freeze FM, Heat FM, Manic FM and big crews would often have a weekly spot on one of these and would bring their DJ, a bag of MCs and they would all spit over new, old and unreleased grime instrumentals. These shows were often recorded onto tapes by listeners and many can be heard today, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqBKAmeRamM#t=1m58s) &amp; [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UdBSxZ067k&amp;feature=related) are some footage of radio shows. The vocal elements of Grime extended to raves, mixtapes, albums and DVDs, which were all often produced independently. The lyrical content is similar to that of Hip-Hop and often deals with inner city themes, though considerably less conscious than some hip-hop and more emphasising crime. Here are some examples of vocal grime:

Trouble Will Find Me (imho) has that same atmosphere to it: It is the calm after depression, the eye of a hurricane in many ways. You can't feel positive afterwards, but you also are not rattled like their previous efforts. 

On a completely separate note, the mastering on this album is leagues ahead of High Violet, which was one of the reasons I could never get into it. It is very clean, with some muddled effects, but nothing to the extent of HV, which felt very fake and off putting. 

What are your opinions on it?

  It really is a fantastic album. I think this release will get a lot of criticism for being slow, depressing, melancholy, boring, somber and every other adjective for ""sad"" imaginable, but this is a fantastic album with some incredibly heartfelt ballads. I Need My Girl, Graceless, Slipped, Heavenfaced, This Is the Last Time.... fuck it, the whole second half of the album is absolutely surreal and tragically beautiful and some of the best stuff Matt Berninger has composed. There's honestly not a bad song on this album, and as weird as it is to say I think this album benefits from not having a stand out track. It's utterly cohesive and poignant, I love it.

Since we are such a large musical mind as a community, it'd be interesting, I thought, to see which users can share information about much smaller, more esoteric or underground, genres or subgenres of music.

**If there is a subgenre of music you are particularly passionate about that you don't think this community has necessarily heard of, please post a summary, any insight into its history, and links to examples!** (Note I don't intend this to be a recommendation topic, more an enlightenment to lesser aspects of musical culture or history) I'm going to describe **Turkish Psychedelic Rock** music.

Psychedelic rock music is well known but Turkey has had its own  fantastic scene since the '60s - one that has flourished in spite of governmental and even societal suppression of rock music. The Turkish sound borrows heavily from the West but is mixed in with more Eastern, Turkish-folk sounds, instruments and singing. The musicians come across as *feeling* the music so very strongly and it has a slightly otherworldly emotional quality.

Some artists to check out:

**Erkin Koray**

Godfather of Turkish rock music (first person ever to play Rock 'n' Roll in Turkey back in the '50s). Was assaulted several times and stabbed for having long hair. 

[Erkin Koray - Cemalim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0gjwpMb-k8)

[Erkin Koray - Yağmur](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnkwBi6IAl4)

**Selda Bağcan**

Selda was one of the only female artists popular in the scene, but her powerful emotional voice and fuzzed out psychedelia are mind-blowing. Often highly controversial, she was persecuted in the '80s for her political songs.

[Selda - Ince Ince](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruGXTt4P_0M)

**Bunalim**

The definitive sound of Turkish psychedelia - a rock group that released an explosive album of fuzzed out spacieness. Their name means ""Depression"" or ""Frustration"" in Turkish. They existed for a brief 2 years at the start of the '70s and then split up, leaving behind one seminal album.

[Bunalim - Başak Saçlim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM8YjKsBDC4&amp;feature=related)

**Moğollar**

Pioneers of Turkish rock music, their sound blends traditional Anatolian folk music with rock.

[Moğollar - Dinleyiverin Gari](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSbSrmGsiuw&amp;feature=related)

**Cem Karaca** 

Prominent member of Moğollar and an accomplished solo performer. Persecuted for his politics in the '80s. In the '70s he was heavily influenced by French beat poetry and went solo to persue a more progressive sound.

[Cem Karaca - Islak Islak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Za1njKl9Fg)

Other noteworthy artists:

**Edip Akbayram**

[Edip Akbayram - Yakar Inceden Inceden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXcIqQHhlrQ)

**Üç Hürel**

**Alpay**

The Wire did a fantastic primer on the genre if you're interested (might be available online now). Otherwise I can recommend the superb compilation album: **Love, Peace &amp; Poetry – Vol.9 Turkish** as a starting point (from the sublime Love, Peace &amp; Poetry series exploring obscure psychedelic rock from around the world).

What about you? I love a vast number of musical genres. In fact, I just like music. There are bands I like and don't like in genres, but I would never say there is a genre that, as a whole, I don't like anything in.

Most recently, I have been expanding my tastes into the ""drone"" genre. I listened to Earth's  The Bees Made Honey in the Lions Skull and wasn't all that impressed(I felt it was too repetitious, but I did use it as background studying music enjoyably a little later). Then I gave Monoliths and Dimensions by Sunn O))) a try and found it more experimental and interesting (my criticism of this album might be it's too droney if that makes any sense) but still wouldn't say I have broken into the genre yet. I look forward to delving into both of these bands earlier works, as they seem to be held as the pillars of the genre.

I am feeling horribly empty. The reverb, the echoes, the static of the TV, the distant hazy voices, the sheer desperation... this is a devastating album, but epic in a microcosmic sense. Universal, yet subjective. Everyone has their own mothers and walls. 

Disc 1 chronicles the bricks, the slow descent of sanity and ascent of the wall. I was listening to [""Mother""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmmKzEKYvdM) when I realized Pink just wants someone to hold his hand. He's retreating and keeps trying to return to her. 

Disc 2 starts off with a deeply ominous tone. Aeroplanes, the lack of control, the death of innocence. And in [""Empty Spaces""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARXKvVeVtXg) Pink is trying to fill those empty spaces with emptiness. And then he's so bitter and angry and loud, which escalates further and further until it all blends together into incoherent droning broken by... that single, final slam. Pink angrily destroys his house in [""One of My Turns""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqEytMfQCLI) but that final ""Why are you running away?"" sounds full of despair and desolation. His cutoff ""goodby-"" as the wall is completed in [""Goodbye Cruel World""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-R7KsE3-Y) was particularly striking. 

The next disc is full of all this fuzzy noise: the sound of an empty room. ""Divided we fall, fall, fall, fall"" and falling. Then again with the layering on ""Is there anybody OUT THERE!""

And finally, we get to the end. He becomes a dictator. The Judge in his mind commands to tear down this wall. And the album ends on a lukewarm note. Loneliness is still there. And the ending! ""Isn't this where we come in?"" This reminds me of a [Hopper](http://foxpudding.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/hopper2auto.jpg) [painting](http://www.artchive.com/artchive/h/hopper/nighthwk.jpg) or of Caldwell's [*Tobacco Road.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Road_(novel\)) It continues this never ending cycle, or maze rather, of isolation. 

My friend and I were trying to match this up with Campbell's [monomyth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth) if anyone here's familiar with that. My friend thinks that the album as a whole focuses on the Initiation (into a person), which I definitely agree with. Women and the Mother also match up. I think some version of a ""Confrontation with the Father"" occurs during ""The Trial"" and that Pink is narrating from outside the wall, where he has experienced both worlds to some extent. I'm not sure he ever achieves the final step of accepting mortality and living though. 

Anyways, I've talked for long enough. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this album! I'm writing this right off of my first listen-through, so please add anything I've missed.

(in my opinion) When I think of post punk I don't just think of music, I don't just think of bands instead I think of the scene, the mood and how the music interacts with this. I imagine walking down a gloomy street, its a miserable, grey and gloomy evening, you walk up an alleyway and duck into a dingy basement bar, dark, stuffy and claustrophobic but filled with like minded people. I imagine an intense air of anticipation building as everyone gets ready to turn themselves loose, their insecurities, anxieties and repressed emotions ready to explode into an assembly of jittering bodies to the tune of jagged guitar riffs and desperate vocals.
http://youtu.be/WpRYNkRD5D4

And that is the song I imagine.
It encapsulates everything, in the beginning a simple repetitive chord starts it all off, then to add to the tension Sam Fogarino's drums begin to roll while a restless Daniel Kessler begins to scratch at his guitar only to erupt into play seconds later. This builds until it can't be held in any longer and Paul Banks frantic voices cries out, the guitar riffs change and you can't help but dance like a man possessed, the crowd around you rolls and undulates and you are taken up with it until you loose all control, you are all in this together, Pauls vocals cry out about sordid relationships untill a momentary pause, ""one two three do me"" 

The masses of people around you now loose it completely, in a sea of limbs and screams the music won't let up the serrated guitar riffs, drums perfectly in step and electric bass lines force you to shake it like your life depended on it. But then they bring it down as the vocals become more confined so to does the music, desperate to escape it builds up again to a head then you're back dancing your ass off again. The songs begins to drifts off, its energy spent, you drift with it until you snap back to boring, bleak reality. This to me is the definition of post punk. Or maybe i'm reading into it too much..

 I love how you've written this and thank you for sharing your emotional description. Plenty of feeling in that. 
  
My memories of post punk are more from the post punk era (78-84) rather than the revival, and because it's such a broad term there's no one song or record or band that represents it for me. If you include Violent Femmes then [Add It Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7y9yChV478) represents that anarchic unloved teen that was a part of who I was at the time. [Midnight Oil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgukduYJZ44) represent the angry political part of the teen I was. But above all the term post punk brings back memories of [The Laughing Clowns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vy9_RJPSo), [Nick Cave](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSl4KX7zBTQ) and if I really have to name a song that represents the term, it's [this song; Shiver.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7ChSy6FhxQ)",Add It Up,Violent Femmes,81.8181818181818,57.1428571428571,"['simple repetitive chord', 'restless Daniel Kessler scratching guitar', 'Paul Banks frantic voice', 'serrated guitar riffs', 'drums perfectly in step', 'electric bass lines', 'vocals become more confined', 'desperate to escape']","['Post punk scene, mood, and interaction', 'Violent Femmes representing anarchic unloved teen', 'Midnight Oil representing angry political teen', 'The Laughing Clowns and Nick Cave as post punk memories']","['Walking down a gloomy street', 'Duck into a dingy basement bar', 'Intense air of anticipation', 'Turn themselves loose', 'Their insecurities, anxieties, and repressed emotions ready to explode']","['Gloomy street', 'Miserable, grey evening', 'Dark, stuffy and claustrophobic bar', 'Intense anticipation', 'Desperate vocals', 'Exploding into a sea of limbs and screams', 'Taken up with the crowd', 'Boring, bleak reality']",,,"[['Add It Up', 'Violent Femmes'], ['Shiver', 'Nick Cave'], ['Midnight Oil', 'Midnight Oil']]","Walking down a gloomy street on a miserable, grey evening, you duck into a dark, stuffy, and claustrophobic bar, sensing an intense air of anticipation.

(or: records you love that critics hated.) this is a good question to ask at a slow party if you end up talking to another music head. I've seen a bottle get broken out of sheer enthusiasm during the explanation^# , so I'm hoping for something interesting from reddit.


I have a lot of these, but Scott Weiland's *12 bar blues* is a good one because it wasn't just dismissed by critics, it also didn't sell very well and has completely fallen into the margins of history at this point. especially given that you occasionally have to remind people [who Scott Weiland is.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht672-wYelc) *spin* and *rolling stone* hated it (I think David Fricke called it confused and indulgent), and stone temple pilots fans rejected it on principle for not sounding like STP. but the record remains outrageously interesting even just for being a weird hybrid of grungy glam, lounge, and extremely aggressive electronics a la layers of heavily distorted theremin. these production decisions are really what keeps the album together, constantly jumping between being so prominent as to virtually throttle the rest of the music and being barely audible. and, as if that wasn't enough, this all happens on top a revolving door of songs that sound kinda like tom waits teamed up with slade to cover *hunky dory.* there's also this guy named [Victor Indrizzo](http://www.victorindrizzo.com/) who has credits all over the record; I have a suspicion that he had a lot to do with the adventures in sound contained thereon, particularly because Scott's second solo album sounds [nothing like this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrXyzGvpuxA)

^# to pre-empt the first comment, the record was *monster* by REM. hm, I seem to recall Spin giving *12 Bar Blues* 7/10, though they are otherwise rather hostile towards STP as a whole. I would add STP's first 2 albums. I never really understood the hate for the band as it seems like their biggest sin was being one of the first bands to really benefit from the Alternative/Grunge explosion, even if they had been around for a few years prior. I think there's much more egregious examples out there.


I would also add **Baby 81** by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. Their previous album, *Howl*, seemed to get an inexplicable amount of acclaim for an album that was essentially just recorded while they waited for their drummer to stop fucking around, but the critics seems to dislike Baby 81 even though it was fairly in line with their (generally positively received) first 2 albums, yet integrated the folkier aspects of Howl. Like pretty much all of BRMC's catalogue, Baby 81 could've used some trimming, but it's otherwise on par with their first 2 albums.


also, not really lacking critical acclaim, but Swans' post-*Children of God* period seems to be retroactively taboo of sorts, even though I think it's probably their best period. I find their early stuff more interesting than good as there's not really much variety to it; if anything, it created a template that yielded better results in other bands (i.e. Loop, Godflesh, etc.). Though I do like the melding of the 2 periods in Swans' current incarnation, especially one the *We Rose from Our Beds...* live album, even if leans more towards the earlier period.",Jimmy Was a Stimulator,Scott Weiland,83.3333333333333,78.5714285714285,"['weird hybrid of grungy glam, lounge, and extremely aggressive electronics', 'layers of heavily distorted theremin', 'production decisions keep the album together', 'constantly jumping between being prominent and barely audible']","[""12 Bar Blues dismissed by critics and didn't sell well"", 'Spin and Rolling Stone hated 12 Bar Blues', 'Stone Temple Pilots fans rejected 12 Bar Blues for not sounding like STP', '12 Bar Blues sounds like Tom Waits teamed up with Slade to cover Hunky Dory', ""BRMC's Baby 81 fairly in line with their first 2 albums yet disliked by critics"", ""BRMC's Howl received inexplicable amount of acclaim"", ""Swans' post-Children of God period seems retroactively taboo""]",['good question to ask at a slow party'],['outrageously interesting for being unique'],,,"[['12 Bar Blues', 'Scott Weiland'], ['Jimmy Was a Stimulator', 'Scott Weiland'], ['Cool Kiss', 'Scott Weiland'], ['Desperation No 5', 'Scott Weiland'], ['Baby 81', 'Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'], ['Howl', 'Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'], ['Monster', 'REM'], ['We Rose from Our Beds...', 'Swans'], ['Children of God', 'Swans']]","Hybrid of rungy glam, lounge, and extremely aggressive electronics, featuring layers of heavily distorted theremin that constantly jump between being prominent and barely audible.

Absolute banger of an album. I'm not sure how popular it is on this sub, but it's worth posting anyway.  I think these are pretty well-rated in general, but I'd love to see them get more attention... so hope that counts!

**Bubblemath** \- [Edit Peptide](https://bubblemath.bandcamp.com/album/edit-peptide)*.*  Dense, frenetic tunes.  Catchy stuff all over the place.  Tending towards heavy, but with chill moments here and there.  Lots going on—if you like intricacy in your music, give this a listen.

**Birds and Buildings** \- [Multipurpose Trap](https://birdsandbuildings.bandcamp.com/album/multipurpose-trap).  Hard to choose between Dan Britton's albums, but let's go with this one.  Incredible variety and inventiveness on this album (e.g. ""Aviator Prosco"", where ""prosco"" means ""progressive disco""—yes, really).  Tight playing, and nothing else sounds like it.

**Fifth Species** \- [Life in the Punch Line](https://fifthspecies.bandcamp.com/album/life-in-the-punch-line)*.*  If you follow the sub closely, you saw this posted about a month ago upon release by our very own /u/Jerameme.  Modernized Gentle Giant feels with great musicianship and a lot of variety.  Really great stuff.

**Kotebel** \- [Ouroboros](https://kotebel-music.bandcamp.com/album/ouroboros)*.*  Masterful symphonic compositions, fantastic playing.  Feels subtly Spanish (the band is from Spain), but mixes it well with modern, innovative-sounding, progressive music.

**Maneige** \- [Ni vent... ni nouvelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCveA15FDaw)*.*  This is the epitome of playful music.  Great melodies everywhere, full of curveballs.  I wish there were more albums like this.  (If you know this album and have recommendations, I'd love to hear them.)

**Miriodor** \- [Avanti!](https://cuneiformrecords.bandcamp.com/album/avanti)  So this one actually feels a bit like the Maneige album—super fun, though a little less ""light"" at parts.

 I saw the Gizz live just last week, and they were spectacular. ""Lord of Lightning,"" ""Crumbling Castle,"" and the whole microtonal set were the highlights for me.

I'd definitely call them prog, especially after that wild, eclectic, experimental run of five albums last year: microtonal music, ""post-audiobook,"" psychedelic jazz/fusion, polyrhythmic song-suites, and so on. Any band that's willing to experiment with that many different sounds, and has the musical chops to pull them all off, qualifies as ""progressive"" in my book.

I tend to like a very specific type of track... the best way I can describe them is theatrical, catchy, perhaps a little cheesy, blends genres/influences, melodic... wouldn't sound out of place in a rock/metal musical. Below are some prog rock/metal examples of my fav tracks:

\- Many of the tracks on The Astonishing - Dream Theater.... but in particular I LOVE 'Lord Nafaryus'. I also like 'When your time has come', 'saviour in the square', and 'Three Days'.

\- Cockroach King by Haken - catchy and a little weird.

\- Ayreon - the theory of everything (the title track) - super catchy, great riff, different.

\- A little piece of heaven - Avenged Sevenfold (this is catchy, funny, tells an interesting (albeit very dark) story.

Other track, band, or album suggestions are welcomed and appreciated. **Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds**

Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds is the debut studio album by Jeff Wayne, retelling the story of The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells, released in the UK 9 June 1978.  A concept album, its main format is progressive rock and string orchestra, using narration and leitmotifs to carry the story and rhyming melodic lyrics that express the feelings of the various characters. The two-disc album remains a bestseller, having sold millions of records around the world, and by 2009 it was the 40th best selling album of all time in the UK with sales of 2,561,286. It has since spawned multiple versions of the album, video games, DVDs, and live tours.
