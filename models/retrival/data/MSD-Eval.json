It's part of the album \"Permanent Waves\" released in 1980 by Rush, a band known for their dynamic live performances. The song is uplifting and inspirational, evoking a sense of freedom and rebellion, while being nostalgic yet forward-looking. As such, it's a great morning motivator, a perfect soundtrack for a road trip, and ideal for live concert experiences; \"The Spirit of Radio\" was a commercial success and remains a fan favorite.",

The work is majestic, ethereal, and carefully crafted, driven by mostly Eastern-European guitarists who are extremely talented and very young.
